All I Want For Christmas Is You,['Mariah Carey'],"
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah

I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need 
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace 
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day

I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow 
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick 
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click

'Cause I just want you here tonight 
Holding on to me so tight 
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby

Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere 
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air 
And everyone is singing 
I hear those sleigh bells ringing 
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? 
Won't you please bring my baby to me?

Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for 
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door

Oh, I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you

You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby

Last Christmas,['Wham!'],"

Ah, ah-ah
Ooh-woah
Oh-oh

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away 
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special 

Once bitten and twice shy
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye
Tell me, baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me
""Happy Christmas,"" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying, ""I love you,"" I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away 
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special 
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special 
Oh, oh, baby

A crowded room, friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face-on lover with a fire in his heart
A man undercover, but you tore me apart
Ooh-ooh
Now I've found a real love, you'll never fool me again

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away 
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special 
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away 
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special 

A face-on lover with a fire in his heart 
A man undercover, but you tore him apart
Maybe next year
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special

Special
Someone
Someone
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
Who give me something in return

Hold my heart and watch it burn
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone special
I thought you were here to stay
How could you love me for a day?
I thought you were someone special
I gave you my heart
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone

Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
You gave it away
I'll give it to someone, I'll give it to someone

Die With A Smile,"['Lady Gaga', 'Bruno Mars']","


I, I just woke up from a dream
Where you and I had to say goodbye
And I don't know what it all means
But since I survived, I realized

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you



Ooh, lost, lost in the words that we scream
I don't even wanna do this anymore
'Cause you already know what you mean to me
And our love's the only war 
worth fighting for

Wherever you go, that's where I'll follow
Nobody's promised tomorrow
So I'ma love you every night like it's the last night
Like it's the last night

If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was through
I'd wanna hold you just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you

Right next to you
Next to you
Right next to you
Oh-oh

If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to 
you
If the party was over
And our time on Earth was 
through
I'd wanna hold you
 
just for a while
And die with a smile
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you
If the world was ending
I'd wanna be next to you


I'd wanna be next to you"
Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree,['Brenda Lee'],"
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later, we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling

You will get a sentimental feeling
When you hear
Voices singing, ""Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly""

Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone's dancin' merrily
In the new old-fashioned way


You will get a sentimental feeling

Jingle Bell Rock,['Bobby Helms'],"
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowin' and blowin' up 
bushels
 of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancin' and prancin' in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go glidin' in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy up, jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jinglin' feet
That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time

Birds Of A Feather,['Billie Eilish'],"

I want you to stay
'Til I'm in the grave
'Til I rot away, dead and buried
'Til I'm in the casket you carry
If you go, I'm goin' too, uh
'Cause it was always you 
And if I'm turnin' blue, please don't save me
Nothin' left to lose without my baby

Birds of a feather, we should stick together
, I know
I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
Can't change the weather, might not be forever
But if it's forever, it's even better

And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
It might not be long, but baby, I

I'll love you 'til the day that I die
'Til the day that I die
'Til the light leaves my eyes
'Til the day that I die

I want you to see, hm
How you look to me, hm
You wouldn't believe if I told ya
You would keep the compliments I throw ya
But you're so full of shit, uh
Tell me it's a bit, oh
Say you don't see it, your mind's polluted
Say you wanna quit, don't be stupid

And I don't know what I'm cryin' for
I don't think I could love you more
Might not be long, but baby, I
Don't wanna say goodbye

Birds of a feather, we should stick together,
 I know 

I said I'd never think I wasn't better alone
 

Can't change the weather, might not be forever
 

But if it's forever, it's even better

I knew you in another life
You had that same look in your eyes
I love you, don't act so surprised"
Santa Tell Me,['Ariana Grande'],"
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
""Let It Snow"" is blasting out
But I won't get in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's

True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy

Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year

Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh
On the 25th, by that fireplace, oh-woo-oh
But I don't want a new broken heart
This year I've got to be smart
Oh, baby

If he will be, if he will be here

Oh, woah

Santa, tell me  if you're really there 
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me  if he really cares 
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me  if you're really there 
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year 
Santa, tell me  if he really cares 
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year"
That’s So True,['Gracie Abrams'],"
I could go and read your mind
Think about your dumb face all the time
Living in your glass house, I'm outside, uh
Looking into big blue eyes
Did it just to hurt me, make me cry
Smiling through it all, yeah, that's my life

You're an idiot, now I'm sure
Now I'm positive, I should go and warn her

Ooh, bet you're thinking, ""She's so cool""
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh

What'd she do to get you off? 
Taking down her hair like, oh my God
Taking off your shirt, I did that once
Or twice, uh
No, I know, I know I'll fuck off 
But I think I like her, she's so fun
Wait, I think I hate her, I'm not that evolved

I'm sorry she's missing it, sad, sad boy
Not my business, but I had to warn ya

Ooh, bet you're thinking, ""She's so cool""
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
Ooh, you've got me thinking, ""She's so cool""
But I know what I know and you're just another dude
Ooh, that's so true, ooh

Made it out alive, but I think I lost it
Said that I was fine, said it from my coffin
Remember how I died when you started walking?
That's my life, that's my life
I'll put up a fight, taking out my earrings
Don't you know the vibe? Don't you know the feeling?
You should spend the night, catch me on your ceiling
That's your prize, that's your prize
Well

Mm, bet you're thinking, ""She's so cool""
Kicking back on your couch, making eyes from across the room
Wait, I think I've been there too, ooh
Ooh, you've got me thinking, ""She's so cool""
But I know what I know and you're just another dude
Ooh, that's so true, ooh, ooh, oh"
Underneath The Tree,['Kelly Clarkson'],"
You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

Tonight , I'm gonna hold you close 
Make sure that you know 
I was lost before you 
Christmas was cold and grey 
Another holiday 
Alone to celebrate

But then , one day 
Everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree

I found  what I was looking for 
A love that's meant for me 
A heart that's mine completely 
Knocked me right off my feet 
And this year I will fall 
With no worries at all

'Cause you  are near 
And everything's clear
You're all I need
Underneath the tree

You're here where you should be
Snow is falling as the carolers sing
It just wasn't the same
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight
You're all that I need
Underneath the tree


And then, one day, everything changed
You're all I need
Underneath the tree, yeah

You're here where you should be 
Snow is falling as the carolers sing 
It just wasn't the same 
Alone on Christmas day
Presents, what a beautiful sight 
Don't mean a thing if you ain't holding me tight 
You're all that I need 
Underneath the tree, tonight

Oh, you're all I need
Underneath, underneath the tree, oh"
It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas,['Michael Buble'],"
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon, the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Sure it's Christmas once more"
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!,['Dean Martin'],"
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow"

If you miss me

Me nowhere

Uh
I done seen it all, oh my God, I swear
Uh, uh

Nothing new under the sun, nobody fucking with son
I got a couple of sons, a couple of guns
A couple of niggas that bust up the party and fuck up the fun
She digging me and I’m cuffing her friend
She ig'-ing you while we fucking for fun
I got her suckin' her thumb, that’s my lil' baby
She call me daddy like grandmama baby
If this Sunday dinner, my hand on her gravy
I been on the craziest wave, if I'm on the stage
An M is my minimum wage
This ain't no kennel, behave
Niggas is with all that barking, we send 'em a stray
So in a way we the dogcatchers
How many bullets your dawg catchin'?
Sawed-off, raw dog fashion
Hauled off, hope God catch him, damn

I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with, ayy

Potato over my gun
I move in silence 'cause niggas be clocking my funds
When they should keep eye on they bitch ’cause baby girl coming with son
Niggas be judging my moves, but please tell me, what have you done?
My cousin might air out the party for fun
Pistol grips get to squeezing
Wish a nigga would like Liam Neeson
I don’t even need a reason, loyalty over treason
Bitch nigga, come and see me
Put some respect on my name
What side of my city I claim
I try to stay in my lane
Took my advance and put a Caprice on them thangs
I'm Beatties Ford ’til the wheels fall
Know some niggas probably pissed off
Who would thought I made it this far?
Gold Mouf, bitch, fuck 'em all

I woke up for some money, ayy, lil' bitch
Too many opps in here, tell me who you with

I just put diamonds on all of my teeth, now they probably think I ain't intelligent
In the homicide unit interrogation, asking questions, you know I ain’t tell 'em shit
Bitches call me a jock, all-American
I'm at the top of my class with my lettermen
I remember back in college, bitches knocking on my dorm door
I ain't never let 'em in
Now you know that that's cap, know I hit a few
Ain't no job, I'm selling gas like I'm Jiffy Lube
I had a freak, used to fuck while her boyfriend in class
I hit her from the back from like 10 to 2
No back and forth with these rappers
They mention me, dissin' me
No talkin' back, I won't mention you
Watch, when I come put that iron on your ass and I dip
They gon' want me to snitch in my interviews
I'm on fire, bitch, I'm lit, but I'm really cool
Don't acknowledge the shrimps when they ridicule
They don't come out after dark, bitch, I swim with the sharks
You ain't got enough heart, get a bigger pool
Wanna fight but he bigger, I ain't really trippin'
Reach under my shirt, grab a bigger tool
I got a 
Glock with a dick

They gon' be hollerin' out, ""

Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
There's a birthday party
At the home of Farmer Gray
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day
We'll be singing the songs
We love to sing without a single stop
At the fireplace while we watch
The chestnuts pop; Pop! Pop! Pop!
There's a happy feeling
Nothing in the world can buy
When they pass around the chocolate
And the pumpkin pie
It'll nearly be like a picture print
By Currier and Ives
These wonderful things are the things
We remember all through our lives!
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling
Ring-ting-tingling too
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Outside the snow is falling
And friends are calling, ""Yoo hoo""
Come on, it's lovely weather
For a sleigh ride together with you
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
Let's go, let's look at the show
We're riding in a wonderland of snow
Giddy yap, giddy yap, giddy yap
It's grand, just holding your hand
We're riding along with a song
Of a wintry fairy land
Our cheeks are nice and rosy
And comfy cozy are we
We're snuggled up together
Like two birds of a feather would be
Let's take that road before us
And sing a chorus or two
Come on, it's lovely weather

Beautiful Things,['Benson Boone'],"
For a while there, it was rough
But lately, I've been doin' better
Than the last four cold Decembers I recall
And I see my family every month
I found a girl my parents love
She'll come and stay the night, and I think I might have it all
And I thank God every day
For the girl He sent my way
But I know the things He gives me, He can take away
And I hold you every night
And that's a feeling I wanna get used to
But there's no man as terrified as the man who stands to lose you

Oh, I hope I don't losе you
Mm, please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
Thеse beautiful things that I've got

Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh, God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

Oh, ooh
Please don't take

I found my mind, I'm feelin' sane
It's been a while, but I'm finding my faith
If everything's good and it's great, why do I sit and wait 'til it's gone?
Oh, I'll tell ya, I know I've got enough
I've got peace and I've got love
But I'm up at night thinkin' I just might lose it all

Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God
Don't take
These beautiful things that I've got

Oh, ooh

Please stay
I want you, I need you, oh God

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeers really know how to fly

And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you

Toxic Till The End,['Rosé'],"
Call us what we are, toxic from the start
Can't pretend that I was in the dark
When you met my friends, didn't even try with them
I should've known right then

That you were jealous and possessive
So manipulatin'
Honestly, impressive
You had me participatin'

Back then, when I was runnin' out of your place
I said, ""I never wanna see your face""
I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end
Uh-huh, 'cause even when I said it was over
You heard, ""Baby, can you pull me in closеr?""
You were plotting how to stay in my head
Wе were toxic till the end

Ladies and gentlemen
I present to you
The ex

His favourite game is chess, who would ever guess?
Playing with the pieces in my chest
Now he's on the screen and saying, ""Don't leave""
You stole that line from me

'Cause you're just jealous and possessive
So manipulatin'
Honestly, impressive
You had me participatin'

Back then, when I was runnin' out of your place
I said, ""I never wanna see your face""
I meant I couldn't wait to see it again
We were toxic till the end
Uh-huh, 'cause even when I said it was over
You heard, ""Baby, can you pull me in closer?""
You were plotting how to stay in my head
We were toxic till the end, end, end

I can forgive you for a lot of things
For not giving me back my Tiffany rings
I'll never forgive you for one thing, my dear
You wasted my prettiest years

Back then, when I was runnin' out of your place
I said, ""I never wanna see your face""
I meant I couldn't wait to see it again

Lose Control,['Teddy Swims'],"
Something's got a hold of me lately
No, I don’t know myself anymore
Feels like the walls are all closin' in
And the devil's knockin’ at my door, woah
Out of my mind, how many times did I tell you
I'm no good at bein' alone?
Yeah, it's taken a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep
From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I’m fallin’ apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control
When you’re not next to me, mhm
Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby
You make a mess of me

Problematic
The problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit
Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you
Yeah, I know I can do it on my own
But I want that real full-moon black magic and it takes two
Problematic
The problem is when I’m with you I'm an addict
And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth
Can't see the forest through the trees
Got me down on my knees, darlin', please, oh

I lose control
When you're not next to me
I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?
I lose control

Shining, shimmering, splendid

Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal-clear
That now, I'm in a whole new world with you

Now I'm in a whole new world with you

Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world 
A hundred thousand things to see 
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

A whole new world 
With new horizons to pursue
 


I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world

A whole new world

That's where we'll be

That's where we'll be

A thrilling chase

A wondrous place

Looking like Anne Hathaway
Laughing while she hit her pen and coughed, and coughed
And then she came up to my knees
Begging, ""Baby, would you please
Do the things you said you'd do to me, to me?""

Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in this favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long

She took my fingers to her mouth
The kind of thing that makes you proud
That nothing else had ever worked out, worked out
And lately, I tried other things
But nothing can capture the sting
Of the venom she's gonna spit out right now

Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
And when you get a taste, can you tell me, what's my flavor?
I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
I know that you've been worried, but you're dripping in my favor
And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
I sleep so I can see you 'cause I hate to wait so long
I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long

Things fall apart
And time breaks your heart

You showed her the world
But fell out of love and you both let go

She was cryin’ on my shoulder
All I could do was hold her
Only made us closer until July
Now, I know that you love me

I should put it all behind me, shouldn't I?

But I see her in the back of my mind

Like a sign
Did I cross the line?
 Hmm

Well, good things don't last 
And life moves so fast 
I'd never ask who was better 
'Cause she couldn't be 
More different from me 
Happy and free in leather

You don’t need to remind me 
Wanna put it all behind me, but baby

I see her in the back of my mind 
All the time 
Feels like a fever , like I’m burning alive

You say no one knows you so well 
But every time you touch me, I just wonder how she felt

Siento un vacío muy frío por dentro, mi amor
Cuando te fuiste, te robaste mi corazón
Me quedé loco de tanto pensar y pensar
Me iré al infierno, pero me tengo que vengar
Quiero manchar el vestido blanco de rojo
Sé que el altar dе Dios es santo, pero, mi amor
Cien invitados y todos tеndrán que mirar
Que nuestro amor va al más allá

Quiero que bailemos juntos
En el cielo, el infierno, pero sin ese puto
El que te ha apartado todo este tiempo de mí
Al inconsciente que hizo que no fueras pa' mí
Danza, una danza eterna
Pero me voy contigo, pero nos vamos juntos
Llevo tres noches malditas sin poder dormir
Solo pensando y pensando que eres para mí
 

¡Uh!
Me despido de ti para siempre, chiquitita
Ahí le va para todos los que traen el corazón roto
Uh
Y su compa Óscar Maydon
Fuer-za Regida

Camino lento, me duele la respiración
A mil por hora latidos de mi corazón
En el pasillo me vienen recuerdos, flashbacks
Prometimos que los dos iríamos al altar
Te quitó el velo, aceptaste y luego te besó
Ya has consumado los votos sagrados, mi amor
Un frío muy intenso se llevó todo mi ser
Ya no hay razón pa' estar de pie

Quiero que bailemos juntos
En el cielo, el infierno, pero sin ese puto
Al que te ha apartado todo este tiempo de mí
Al inconsciente que hizo que no fueras pa' mí
Danza, una danza eterna
Pero me voy contigo, pero nos vamos juntos
Llevo tres noches malditas sin poder dormir
Solo pensando y pensando que eras para mí

Miro cómo brillan tus ojos
Me resigno perderte y esta vez para siempre
Me arrepentí de quitarte tu felicidad
Te dejaré una familia puedas comenzar
Me despido, me despido pa' siempre
Y te deseo suerte, y bendigo mi muerte
Se la dedico al amor que nunca funcionó
A la persona que roto tiene el corazón

Wanna know my moves and all my spots, but I move clever 
Wanna know my stash, how much I got, but I ain't gon' tell 'em 
Push it, push it, runnin' through it, get that bag, come on

I know she came with you, but she lookin' for me to go home

Feelin' brilliant just like Elon, popped a Tesla 
You ain't got no motion, you can't stand up in my section 
I said, ""Caresha, please""  'cause she too messy 
Bitch fucked my dog behind my back, but I ain't stressin' 
You wanted the gang, you should've just said it, we would've blessed it 
Now shit got messy 
Smokin' exotic shit with an exotic bitch 
Geekin', I'm bringin' all kind of narcotics with me 
Got guns on the table, I'm like, ""Who fire this is?"" 
This bitch got past security, I'm like, ""Who let her in?""

It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreadin' so much cheer

Chestnuts roastin' like a hot July

 Lots of people around
 Baby, please come home

 The church bells in town
 All ringing in song
 Full of happy sounds
 Baby, please come home

They're singing ""Deck the Halls""
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

 Pretty lights on the tree
 I'm watching them shine
 You should be here with me
 Baby, please come home

They're singing ""Deck the Halls""
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

 If there was a way
 I'd hold back this tear
 But it's Christmas day

I think I got an ex, but I forgot him
And I can't find my chill, I must've lost it

I'm talkin' all around the clock
I'm talkin' hope nobody knocks
I'm talkin' opposite of soft

It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Christmas,['Perry Como And The Fontane Sisters With Mitchell Ayres And His Orchestra'],"
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
Take a look at the five and ten
It's glistening once again
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

A pair of hop-a-long boots and a pistol that shoots
Is the wish of Barney and Ben
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk
Is the hope of Janice and Jen
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Everywhere you go
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well
It's the sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Soon, the bells will start
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing
Right within your heart
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas
Toys in every store
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be
On your own front door

Sure it's Christmas once more"

Your past will follow you and wage war on you

Yo te llamo y me quedo en mudez

Quédate

Qué—ay, quédate

Cómo ante' yo te lo metía, tu amiga se fue
¿Por qué te estás quedando? Algo te está faltando, bebé, y

I'll have a blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same, dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'
That's when those blue memories start callin'
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas


You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white

Too Sweet,['Hozier'],"
It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's 10 o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep tellin' me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend
Baby, now and then

Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake
Smellin' like a bonfire, lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great
But while in this world

I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black
 
and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskеy neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for mе
You're too sweet for me

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

I aim low
I aim true, 
and the ground's where I go
I work late where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done
But you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along
Babe, don't get me wrong

You know you're 
bright as the morning, as soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I'll wait
Until that day

I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me

Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah
Woah, woah

I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at 3
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me"
Do They Know It's Christmas?,['Band Aid'],"
It's Christmas time
There's no need to be afraid
At Christmas time
We let in light and we banish shade

And in our world of plenty
We can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world
At Christmas time

]
But say a prayer
Pray for the other ones
At Christmas time 
it's hard
But when you're having fun

There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

Where the only water flowing
Is the bitter sting of tears

And the Christmas bells that ring there
Are the clanging chimes of doom

Well, tonight thank God it's them
Instead of you

And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmas time
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life 
Where nothing ever grows, no rain or rivers flow
Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Here's to you

Raise a glass for everyone

Here's to them

Underneath that burning sun

Do they know it's Christmas time at all?

Feed the world
Feed the world
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again
Feed the world
Let them know it's Christmas time again

Let them know it's Christmas time again

"I Love You, I'm Sorry",['Gracie Abrams'],"
Two Augusts ago
I told the truth, oh, but you didn't like it, you went home
You're in your Benz, I'm by the gate
Now you go alone
Charm all the people you train for, you mean well but aim low
And I'll make it known like I'm getting paid

That's just the way life goes
I like to slam doors closed
Trust me, I know it's always about me
I love you, I'm sorry

Two summers from now
We'll have been talking, but not all that often, we're cool now
I'll be on a boat, you're on a plane
Going somewhere, same
And I'll have a drink
Wistfully lean out my window and watch the sun set on the lake
I might not feel real, but it's okay, mm

'Cause that's just the way life goes
I push my luck, it shows
Thankful you don't send someone to kill me
I love you, I'm sorry

You were the best but you were the worst
As sick as it sounds, I loved you first
I was a dick, it is what it is
A habit to kick, the age-old curse
I tend to laugh whenever I'm sad
I stare at the crash, it actually works
Making amends, this shit never ends
I'm wrong again, wrong again

The way life goes
Joyriding down our road
Lay on the horn to prove that it haunts me

I love you, I'm sorry
The way life goes


I wanna speak in code


Hope that I don't, won't make it about me


I love you, I'm sorry"

And may all your Christmases be white""

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you'll check off my Christmas list

Santa baby, I want a yacht
And really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year

Santa honey, one little thing I really need
The deed
To a platinum mine
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa cutie, and fill my stocking with a duplex
And checks
Sign your 'X' on the line
Santa cutie, and hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

A ring

Christmas comes this time each year
Oooo

Well, way up north where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year working out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick 
It's the little Saint Nick 

Just a little bobsled we call it old Saint Nick
 
But she'll 
walk a toboggan
 with a 
four speed stick
 
She's candy-apple red with a ski for a wheel 
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel
 

It's the little Saint Nick 
It's the little Saint Nick 

Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer 
Run, run, reindeer
Run, run, reindeer
He don't miss no one

And hauling through the snow at a frightening speed 
With a half a dozen deer
 
with Rudy to lead
 
He's gotta wear his goggles because the snow really flies 
And he's cruising 
every pad
 with a little surprise 

It's the little Saint Nick 
It's the little Saint Nick

I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
Devil is a lie,
 
he a 69 God, ayy
Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy

They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
They not like us, they not like us, they not like us

Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
You called Future when you didn't see the club 
Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up 
21 gave you false street cred
Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head 
Quavo said you can be from Northside 
2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
The family matter and the truth of the matter
It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

Mm
Mm-mm
He a fan, he a fan, he a fan 
He a fan, he a fan, he a
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
Let me hear you say, ""OV-ho"" 
Say, ""OV-ho"" 
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way

Are you my friend?
Are we locked in?
Then step this way, step that way
Then step this way, step that way"

Oh-oh
Yeah
Here we go again, hah!

Lo que sucedió 
Fue que lo de nosotro' un día se murió 
Puede' tener a otro y sigo siendo yo , bebé
Te va a perder si te deja sola, yeah , bebé

Es que conmigo tú te vas a to'a

Mírame, admite que no puede' olvidarte de aquella ve'
Él como yo no te parte, dime si lo hacemo' otra ve'
Mírame, admite que no puede' olvidarte de aquella ve'
Él como yo no te parte, dime si lo hacemo' otra ve'

Mírame a los ojos cuando yo te lo esté haciendo
Mami, tú me estás enloqueciendo
Tu bellaquera enciendo, es salvaje, pero me defiendo
Hay tiempo demás pa' conocerno'
Así que bésame, pero esta vez
Si llama mientras te lo hago, contéstale
Tú bien sabe' que pa' ti siempre estaré
Y que pa' tu' fresquería' yo me prestaré, yeh-yeh
Llego y se quita la ropa, el whisky a la roca, la moda de Europa
La toco abajo del conforter cuando se arropa
Ella sabe que yo actúo, el nene no ronca
Y no olvide' cómo te parto, en tu cuarto te recalco
Entre los demás siempre resalto
Y les va a dar un infarto si se enteran que eres de Michael
Cuando le meto se ponen psycho, yeh-yeh-yeh

Tú quieres conmigo y yo quiero contigo 
Pa' la gente tú y yo somo' amigo' 
Pero en la cama tú y yo somos enemigo' 
Tú me dice' si paramo' o sigo 
Digo, digo pa' venirte yo no te obligo 
Tu punto débil yo te lo consigo 
Te doy tan duro que hasta me fatigo
Y tú eres la que a mí me hostiga
Porque a ti te yo no te hostigo, sigo 
Vengan gallinitas y coman trigo 
Que ese culo soy quien te lo ligo 
Chingando con más prendas que los Migos
Y como pa' lo' tiempo' 'e el Father
Vamo' a darle castigo 
Y dale las maletas, por favor 
Que antes del aeropuerto voy pa'l mall 
De Santo Domingo e' el resort 
Y yo te vo'a dar donde no da el sol 

Y yo me la como to'a, su cuerpo me sabe a Passoa
Ella va pa' donde mí siempre que va volver
Y termina corriéndole a él
Y tú quiere' que te busque en la Cayenne
Te metemo' un secuestro donde tú sea' la única rehén
Lo que tú siente' por él murió, amén 
Y en tu mensaje estaba escrito: ""Pa'l carajo!"", dale send
Y cada vez que yo a ti te busco
Y conduzco, en el camino puedo verte
No sé quién te enseñó ese truco
Mami, no es justo, contigo me busco la muerte

Y mírame, admite que, no puede' olvidarte de aquella ve'
Y él como yo no te parte, dime si lo hacemo' otra ve'
Mírame, admite que no puede' olvidarte de aquella ve'
Él como yo no te parte, dime si lo hacemo' otra ve'


Dime si lo hacemos, baby, mírame 
Recuerdo cuando me decía': ""Bebé, mátame 
Hálame por pelo y maltrátame
Agárrame por cuello, de la cama, papi, amárrame
Dile a tu gato que conmigo es que tú 'tás juqueá'
Que de aquí al año que viene te tengo booqueá'
Que tú me mueves el culo rico, en eso estás vaqueá'
Se hizo completa en R.D., 'tá bien enchuleteá'
Quiero volver hacerlo como me lo hiciste, detrás de ti yo voy
No sé que pasó después te me perdiste, y yo voy-voy-voy
Quiero volver hacerlo como me lo hiciste, detrás de ti yo voy
No sé que pasó después te me perdiste, y yo voy-voy-voy

Ella me pide que la castigue
'Tá puesta pa' hacer cosas malas conmigo
Aunque a veces cruzamos lo prohibido 
Solo quedamos como amigos 
Si ella te pide que la castigue
Eso es pa' darle rastrillo a la shorty
Te vas conmigo después de este party
Es que él no sabe cómo trabajar ese body
Tú me dices, así que tú me dices
Acuérdale a tu bellaquera que me avise
Pa' que mi cama otra vez te bautice
Cuando quieras que te haga lo que ya te hice
Si ella te pide que la castigue 
Eso es pa' darle rastrillo a la shorty
Te vas conmigo después de este party
Es que él no sabe cómo trabajar ese body

Yo no quise que fuera un booty call, pero
Quiero que me llame pa' echarme dos tramadol
Anestesia pa'l amor
Pero si te deja sola, va a pagar por el error
Tú quieres acción, pero él no te reta
Para tu adicción tengo la receta
Dime cuánto tengo que esperar para que seas mía completa
Yo sé que flaquea siempre que nos vemo'
Pa' mi que se dio cuenta del nebuleo 
Él tiene de los que mandan, yo tengo de los que dan
Dile que deje el afán, que tú solo eres mi fan
Tú quieres acción, pero él no te reta
Para tu adicción tengo la receta
Dime cuánto tengo que esperar para que seas mía completa

Mírame, admite que no puedes olvidarte de aquella vez
Él como yo no te parte, dime si lo hacemo' otra vez

Walkin On Water,['Stray Kids'],"
Crashing waves, but I'll never fall
Everyday, supernatural
Thrashing rain, I'ma bring the storm
This my stage, walkin' on water
Water, water
, walkin' on
Water, water, walk it off
Water, water, walkin' on
This my stage, my stage

I'm walkin' on water, you can call me 
Harry Potter
I just take all forms, I'ma fill up my bottle
My flow rushes like a wild current
Even on a downhill I still go upstream
I've climbed up to a place not anyone can stand on
I'm naturally hard working, that’s all of me
Not to cut the flow stomp, stomp
Make it flow, make it flow, make it go far

Splash
Pitter-patter, feel the water
Crash
Chitter-chatter, we'rе just gonna
Dance
Walker, walker, 
I'm sеa walkin'
I'ma flow, I'ma flow on the water

Woah 
When you're sinking, I'm fishing, that's my flow

I'ma flow, I'ma flow on the water

Dive, we do ride, we don't hide
Water splashes all around, as we move 
You’re confused and out of breath trying to catch up with me
You thought this would be easy? 
Say hello to Nemo 'cause I can't see
Walking smoothly we look like a 
Basilisk
Water splashing everywhere as we move, splash
This is under my control call me Aqua Man

On the waves, we just play
We're up here, no hurdles in our way
So stay
, join the game
We
 ain't gonna fall down deep into the water

Splash
Pitter-patter, feel the water
Crash
Chitter-chatter, we're just gonna
Dance
Walker, walker, I'm sea walkin'
I'ma flow, I'ma flow on the water

Woah 
When you're sinking, I'm fishing, that's my flow

I'ma flow, I'ma flow on the water

Crashing waves, but I'll never fall
Everyday, supernatural
Thrashing rain, I'ma bring the storm
This my stage, walkin' on water
Crashing waves, but I'll never fall
Everyday, supernatural
Thrashing rain, I'ma bring the storm
This my stage, walkin' on water

Water, water, walkin' on
Water, water, walk it off
Water, water, walkin' on
This my stage, walkin' on water

This my stage, walkin' on water
"
Hallelujah,['Pentatonix'],"
Now I've heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do ya?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing ""Hallelujah""

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong, but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne
 and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You say I took the name in vain
I don't even know the name
But if I did, well, really, what's it to ya?
There's a blaze of light in every word
It doesn't matter which you heard
The holy or the broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

I did my best, it wasn't much
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool ya
And even though it all went wrong
I'll stand before the lord of song
With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Baby, I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew ya
And I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below
But now you never show it to me, do ya?
And remember when I moved in you
The holy dove was moving too
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah

Maybe there's a God above
But all I've ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew ya
And it's not a cry that you hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah"
Like Him,"['Tyler, The Creator', 'Lola Young']","
Damn, nigga, every time I look at you, I swear to God
Nigga, you got that nigga feet

She said that I make expressions like him
My legs to my shoulders and my chin like him
My waist and my posture like him

Mama, I'm chasin' a ghost
I don't know where he is
Mama, I'm chasin' a ghost
Do I look like him?

You gave me love and affection
Attention , protection
How could I ever miss somethin'

I would nevеr judge ya
'Cause evеrything worked out without him

I decided to
Anything that lives inside of you
I would never ever lie to you 
You ain't ever gotta lie to me
I'm everything that I've strived to be
So do I look like him?
Do I look like him? 
I don't look like him


It was my fault, not yours, not his, it was my fault, I'm sorry
You know
It was my fault
Not him, 'cause he always wanted to be there for you
And I'm sorry I was young
But he's always wanted to be a father to you
So I, I fucked up and I take ownership of that
Of my choices and decisions
And I'm sorry for that
He's a good guy
So don't hold that against him, because it was my fault
Just, you know, forgive me"
We Can't Be Friends (Wait For Your Love),['Ariana Grande'],"
I didn't think you'd understand me
How could you ever even try?
I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die
And I'll be alright

We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again

Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love

Me and my truth, we sit in silence
Mm
Baby girl, it's just me and you
'Cause I don't wanna argue, 
but I don't wanna bite
My tongue, yeah, I think I'd rather die
You got me misunderstood
But at least I look this good

We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again

Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love

Know that you made me
I don't like how you paint me, yet I'm still here hanging
Not what you made me
It's somethin' like a daydream
But I feel so seen in the night
So for now, it's only me
And maybe that's all I need

We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again

Wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
Lo-love, I'll wait for your love

I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen, Blitzen, all his reindeer
Pulling on the rein
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say a prayer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed and cover up your head
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He doesn't care if you're rich or poor
He loves you just the same
Santa knows that we're God's children
That makes everything right
Fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Well, here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He'll come around when the chimes ring out
It's Christmas morn again
Peace on Earth will come to all

Please Come Home For Christmas,['Eagles'],"
Bells will be ringing this sad, sad news
Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again

Choirs will be singing, ""Silent Night"" 
Christmas carols by candlelight
 
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night

Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas, my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love

So won't you tell me you'll never more roam 
Christmas and New Year's will find you home 
There will be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, happy once again


Ooh, there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again"

Ey
Dicen que el mundo va a acabarse, ojalá que sea pronto
A veces picheo y me hago el tonto
¿Quién puñeta' dijo que yo quiero ser ejemplo?
To' lo bueno que hago, lo hago porque lo siento
Y está cabrón, wow, ya voy pa' 30
Rolex y AP, yo no sé pa' qué
Si el tiempo pasa y no me doy ni cuenta
Haciendo chavo' mientra' tú comenta'
Pero nadie sabe, no, lo que se siente, ey
Sentirse solo con cien mil persona' al frеnte
Que de ti hablе toda la gente
Sin saber un bicho, sin conocerte
Y hasta te deseen la muerte
Pero yo no, yo les deseo buena suerte, sí, ajá
Ey, la gente tiene que dejar de ser tan estúpida y pensar
Que conocen la vida de los famoso'
Wow, qué mucho podcast, qué mucho baboso
Hoy me levanté aborrecío' como Laura Bozzo
Con gana' 'e dispararle a alguien encima de una pista
Hace tiempo no veo a mi terapista
Quizá por eso es que tengo la mente bizca
Este disco no es pa' ser tocado, ni un billón de vista'
Es pa' que mis fans reales estén contento'
Aunque yo por dentro no me sienta al 100%
Es pa' que me cancelen y me odien
Alce la mano el que quiera ir pa' uno 'e mis concierto'
Vendí el Bugatti porque lo sentía lento, y
Porque los mío' no caben en un asiento
Yo la saqué del parque del primer intento
Estás equivoca'o si crees que estoy en mi momento
Eso no ha llega'o, demasia'o enfoca'o
Tú no conoce' a Bad Bunny, tú solo te has retrata'o, ey
Soy el caballo ganador, voy alante por veinte cuerpo'
Ey, ey
Y sin decir mi nombre tú conoces mi vo'
Dime quién era el mejor, que ya se me olvidó
Desde que yo estoy, e' un orgullo ser el do'
El que nunca se quitó, pues nunca perdió
No me eche' la culpa, échasela a Dio'
Sí, que Él fue el que el don me dio
De hacerlo fácil, je, de hacerlo ver muy fácil, ey
Y es verdad, no soy trapero, ni reggaetonero
Yo soy la estrella más grande en el mundo entero
To's quieren ser número uno, no entiendo el esmero
Si quieres te lo doy, cabrón, yo ni lo quiero
Yo he perdido amore', he perdido dinero
Por mi mejor defecto: ser muy sincero
Pero no pierdo la fe ni las ganas de matarlo'
No es decir que eres real, es demostrarlo
No es decir ""soy el mejor"", hay que probarlo
No e' hacer dinero, mi amor, es multiplicarlo
No me llamen, 'toy corriendo moto en Montecarlo
Porque el dinero se hizo pa' gastarlo, sí
Y la black card no da decline
A ti te escriben to', ustede' siempre han sido AI
Si en WhatsApp hablamo' los mejore' all time
Te sacamo' del group chat, te dejamo' offline
Aprovecho el tiempo haciendo historia y ustede' haciendo storytime, je
Ya no estoy en mi peak, ahora estoy en mi prime
Por eso están rezando que me estrelle, Ayrton Senna
Soy una obra de arte, Mona Lisa, Última Cena
Te va a dar diabete'
Si Sugar 'tá en la loma, tú te baja' en la novena
Yo mismo me impresiono, como Randy Arozarena
Bad Bunny salió, pongan sus disco' en cuarentena
Sonando en to' lao', secuestramo' las antena'
Yo soy del Caribe, meterle cabrón a mí me corre por las vena'
Arroyo 2004 en Atena'
El calentón está que arde
Mi flow se lo debo a Dio' y a Tego Calde
Wow, qué mucho yo chingué en la suite del Vander
Creo que maduré, espero que no sea tarde
A mí no me exija', Bad Bunny no e' alcalde
No me des tu número, yo nunca vo'a llamarte
Dejen de comparar, saben que soy aparte
Disfruten y ya, cada cual hizo su parte, sí
Yo no soy Daddy Yankee, yo no soy Don Omar
Yo soy Bad Bunny, mamabicho, yo no soy normal
Hay mucha gente deseando que me vaya mal
Tristemente a esa gente le toca mamar
Tú no ere' mi fan real, por eso te tiré el celular
A los reale' por siempre los voy a amar
Que hable to' el cabrón que quiera hablar
El que no sabe el cuento siempre lo quiere contar
Las termino con la ""L"", con la ""R"" suenan mal
Sin cojone' me tiene la fama, nunca vo'a cambiar
Yo puedo mudarme de PR
Pero PR de mi alma nunca se podrá mudar

Yo sé que no soy perfecto, y tampoco quiero serlo
Me gusta ser como soy, a veces bueno, a veces malo
Y de ahora en adelante, todas las decisione' de mi vida las voy a hacer pensando en mí y solamente en mí porque al final nunca va' a poder complacerlo' a todo'
Siempre alguien te va a amar y siempre alguien te va a odiar

Nadie sabe lo que va a pasar mañana
Lo que va a pasar mañana
Nadie sabe lo que va a pasar mañana
Lo que va a pasar mañana

Save Your Tears,"['The Weeknd', 'Ariana Grande']","
Ooh
Na-na, yeah

I saw you dancing in a crowded room 
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care

I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day 

I made you think that I would always stay
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time

I don't know why I run away, oh, girl
Said, I make you cry when I run away

Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better

Save your tears for another day 
Save your tears for another day 

I don't know why I run away

Why couldn't you have stayed calm for once
Instead of flying off the handle?
I hope you're happy

I hope you're happy now
I hope you're happy how you've hurt your cause forever
I hope you think you're clever

I hope you're happy

I hope you're happy, too
I hope you're proud how you
Would grovel in submission, to feed your own ambition

So though I can't imagine how
I hope you're happy right now

Elphie, listen to me
Just say you're sorry

You can still be with the Wizard
What you've worked and waited for
You can have all you ever wanted

I know

But I don't want it
No, I can't want it anymore
Something has changed within me
Something is not the same
I'm through with playing by
The rules of someone else's game
Too late for second-guessing
Too late to go back to sleep
It's time to trust my instincts
Close my eyes, and leap
It's time to try defying gravity
I think I'll try defying gravity
And you can't pull me down

Can't I make you understand
You're having delusions of grandeur?

I'm through accepting limits
'Cause someone says they're so
Some things I cannot change
But 'til I try, I'll never know
Too long I've been afraid of
Losing love, I guess I've lost
Well, if that's love
It comes at much too high a cost
I'd sooner buy defying gravity
Kiss me goodbye, I'm defying gravity
And you can't pull me down

Glinda, come with me
Think of what we could do, together

Unlimited
Together, we're unlimited
Together we'll be the greatest team there's ever been, Glinda
Dreams the way we planned 'em

If we work in tandem

There's no fight we cannot win
Just you and I, defying gravity
With you and I defying gravity

They'll never bring us down

Well, are you coming?

I hope you're happy
Now that you're choosing this

You, too

I hope it brings you bliss

I really hope you get it
And you don't live to regret it
I hope you're happy in the end
I hope you're happy, my friend

So if you care to find me
Look to the western sky
As someone told me lately
""Everyone deserves the chance to fly""
And if I'm flying solo
At least, I'm flying free
To those who'd ground me
Take a message back from me
Tell them how I am defying gravity
I'm flying high, defying gravity
And soon, I'll match them in renown
And nobody in all of Oz
No wizard that there is or was
Is ever gonna bring me down!

I hope you're happy

Look at her! She's wicked!
Get her!

No one mourns the wicked 
So we've got to bring her

Oh

You Make It Feel Like Christmas,"['Gwen Stefani', 'Blake Shelton']","
Ooh, Ooh

I want to thank the storm that brought the snow
Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow
But I want to thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

It barely took a breath to realize
We're going to be a classic for all time
I want to thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can't believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too
I want to thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

Thought I was done for, thought that love had died
But you came along, I swear you saved my life
And I want to thank you, baby 

'Cause you make it feel like Christmas


Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can't believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing Hallelujah
Stars are shining on us too
I want to thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

I never thought I'd find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss

Where you at? 
Oh, you got plans? 
Don't say that 
I'm sippin' wine  in a robe 
I look too good 
To be alone 
My house clean , my pool warm 
Just shaved, 
smooth like a newborn
We should be dancin', romancin'
In the east wing and the west wing
Of this mansion, what's happenin'?

I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms

I'ma leave the door open

I'ma leave the door open, girl

That you feel the way I feel
And you want me like I want you tonight, baby


Ooh, you're so sweet , 
so tight 
I won't bite , unless you like 
If you smoke , I got the haze 
And if you're hungry, girl, I got filets 
Ooh, baby, don't keep me waitin'
There's so much love we could be makin' 
I'm talkin' kissin', cuddlin'
Rose petals in the bathtub
Girl, let's jump in, it's bubblin'

I ain't playin' no games
Every word that I say is coming straight from the heart
So if you tryna lay in these arms 

I'ma leave the door open

One seems to hear, words of good cheer
From everywhere, filling the air
Oh, how they pound, raising the sound
O'er hill and dale, telling their tale
Gaily they ring, while people sing
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here

On-on they send, on without end

Christmastime Is Here,['Vince Guaraldi Trio'],"
Out on the third planet closest to the sun
There's a special celebration
And it sounds quite fun
A jolly old fellow brings toys to everyone
On a holiday they call Christmas
Now I'm not gonna lie
It makes no sense to me
But here's what Earthlings told me
About this Christmas mystery
One, two, three four!

Santa is a furry freak
With epic superpowers
He flies to every human home
In under fourteen hours
He's a master burglar
A pro at pickin' locks
If you don't leave milk and cookies out
He will put dung in your socks

If you act nicely through the night
And don't jump on your bed
Santa comes with sugar plums
And hurls them at your head
But if you're on his naughty list
He 
shoots missiles at your toes
He might just roast your chestnuts
With his powerful flamethrower

Rein, rein, rein, rein, rein!
Deer, deer, deer, deer, deer!
I don't know what Christmas is
But Christmastime is here!

He's compelled his creepy elves
To do his every wish
One sought to be a dentist
Now he's sleeping with the fish
Mrs. Claus, she 
works the pole
Plans her man's demise
Soon the elves will all rise up
And stab out Santa's eyes!

Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!
Earthlings are so weird!
I don't know what Christmas is
But Christmastime is here!
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho
Earthlings are so weird
I don't know what Christmas is
But Christmastime is here!

What the heck's a turtle dove
And who 
lit up that deer
?

I don't know what Christmas is
But Christmastime is here!
I don't know what Christmas is
But Christmastime is here!

Or maybe it's there
Or it's somewhere
I don't know"

You know I'm a dreamer
But my heart's of gold
I had to run away high
So I wouldn't come home low

It doesn't mean they were always wrong
Just take this song and you'll never feel
Left all alone
Take me to your heart
Feel me in your bones
Just one more night
And I'm coming off this
Long and winding road

I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home
Tonight, tonight
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
Home sweet home

Too many romantic dreams
Up in lights
Falling off the silver screen
My heart's like an open book
For the whole world to read
Sometimes nothing
Keeps me together
At the seams

Sweater Weather,['The Neighbourhood'],"
And all I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach, but I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater, let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds, but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh

She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

'Cause it's too cold for you here and now
So let me hold both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue 'cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside, this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

Comin' down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothin' that I wouldn't wanna tell you about
No, no, no

Until it's gone, I can never find peace
Waste my whole life just to be

Cruel Summer,['Taylor Swift'],"


Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it 
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it 

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying 
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying 

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar 
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate 
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar 
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate 
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""

El Lokeron,['Tito Double P'],"

Con la gorrita de lado, los ojos tumbados y cargo un placón
Loco cabrón, así me dicen que soy
Los plebes andan ondeados, si bajan los vidrios, un humaderón
Sale el olor a pura flor
Tengo llamadas perdidas, mi morra ya varias veces me marcó
Quiere que ya me regrese pa'l cantón
Y que la dé por perdida, no hay pedo, aquí tengo a su amiga a un lado
Y lo mueve mucho mejor, mucho mejor

No te tengo aquí, a mi lado, pero me la paso chingón
Van cuatro días enfiestado, encerrado, traigo un loquerón
Un loquerón, no es por amor el loquerón

Tito Double P
El loquerón, mi pa
Ay, mamá

Pata a fondo, acelerado, bien adiamantado traigo el Rolexón
Y atrás de mí viene un convoy 
Los plebes andan ondeados, las puntas por fuera, se ve el blindadón
Y en el depa un reventón
Ya empezó y pónganse pilas, que las bandidas llegarán en calor
Y ahí vienen dos pa' Miguelón
No se me duerma, plebada, que ahí vienen morritas de medio millón
En el TikTok, de lo mejor, de lo mejor

No te tengo aquí, a mi lado, pero me la paso chingón
Van cuatro días enfiestado, encerrado, traigo un loquerón
Un loquerón, no es por amor el loquerón

Mele Kalikimaka (Merry Christmas),"['Bing Crosby', 'The Andrews Sisters']","It's been my secret passion to try it
To spend my Christmas surfin', I can't deny it
I wanna spend my Christmas on the Kona Coast in Hawaii
For years I saved my pennies and planned it
The great Pacific Ocean, we'll span it
I wanna spend Christmas where I dig it the most, in Hawaii
Go to Hawaii
Melekalikimaka is ""Merry Christmas"" in Hawaii talk-a
And at Lahaina we'll count the shooting stars
And it will be just you and me in Hawaii
The suntanned beauties are everywhere
If you're comin' to the islands then you might stare
And find a girl waiting for you there in Hawaii
Kani and Wahini and the haoles, too
Wish a Melekalikimaka to you
They're the friendliest people anywhere in Hawaii
Go to Hawaii
Melekalikimaka is how they say it in island talk-a
The island flower fragrance in the air
We'll write a card and underneath the mango trees
We'll say, ""Wish you were here with us in Hawaii""
Winter in the sun and surf'd sure be nice
In a south sea garden paradise
I wanna spend Christmas where I dig it the most, in Hawaii
Honolulu, Waikiki
Do you wanna come along with me?
Waimia up to Hanalai
I'd love to take you to the islands today"

I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits
Not tryna be romantic, I'll hit it from the back
Just so you don't get attached 

You bite my lip just for the taste
You're on your knees,
 
I'm on the case
You take the heat and with such grace
You say we'rе done, but here you stay
Said you'rе scared I'll let you down 
Stick around and you'll find out 
But don't you wanna make me proud? 
'Cause I'm so proud, baby, I'm so proud of you

I like the way you kiss me, I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits
Not tryna be romantic, I'll hit it from the back
Just so you don't get attached 
I like the way you kiss me, I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits
Not tryna be romantic, I'll hit it from the back
Just so you don't get attached 

Do I stress you out? Can I help you out?
Does it turn you on when I turn you 'round?
Can we make a scene?  Can you make it loud? 
'Cause I'm so proud, baby, I'm so proud of you




I like the way you kiss me, I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits
Not tryna be romantic, I'll hit it from the back
Just so you don't get attached 
I like the way you kiss me, I can tell you miss me
I can tell it hits, hits, hits, hits
Not tryna be romantic, I'll hit it from the back
Just so you don't get attached 

I like the way you kiss me
I like the way you, uh"
Every Breath You Take,['The Police'],"
Every breath you take
And every move you make
Every bond you break
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

Every single day
And every word you say
Every game you play
Every night you stay
I'll be watching you

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every 
claim
 you stake
I'll be watching you

Since you've gone, I've been lost without a trace
I dream at night, I can only see your face
I look around, but it's you I can't replace
I feel so cold, and I long for your embrace
I keep crying, baby, baby, please

Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm

Oh, can't you see
You belong to me?
How my poor heart aches
With every step you take

Every move you make
And every vow you break
Every smile you fake
Every claim you stake
I'll be watching you

Every move you make
Every step you take
I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you

I'll be watching you




I'll be watching you




I'll be watching you




I'll be watching you

In The End,['Linkin Park'],"
It starts with one

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time, 
all I know
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away, 
it's so unreal
Didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Tryin' to hold on, d-didn't even know
I wasted it all just to 
watch you go

I kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how 
I tried so hard
In spite of the way you were mockin' me
Actin' like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it 
got so far
Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me 
in the end

You kept everything inside
And even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be
A memory of a time when I tried so hard

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know
I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this, there's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard and got so far
But in the end, it doesn't even matter
I had to fall to lose it all
But in the end, it doesn't even matter"

Y ahora todos tiran beef, yo los vi, son más de dos
Pero eso no es trap, manito, trap es mi negro en prisión
Trap no son tus putas, trap es mi equipo tumbando el club
Tumbando el club, ey , tumbando el club, ey 
Tumbando el club, ey, tumbando el club, ey
Ya saben todos, nos llevamo' el 2026 
Tumbando el club, ey , tumbando el club, ey 
Trap no son tus putas , trap es mi equipo tumbando el club 

Puta, entro escupiendo pura adrenalina
Vaciando tinta en la esquina 
Garchando con la má' fina 
Mirando mal al que mira 
Tirándole al que me tira
Navego entre toa' la mierda 
Negro, no quiero tu cima 
Así que REC, perra, fresh, perra
Sé muy bien que me querés tener, perra
Tres perras me esperan
Creo que una era tu mujer, nigga
Next, nigga, ¿ves, nigga?
Tu grupo nunca lo va a valer, nigga
Mentiras te tiran 
Mis putas ya saben cómo es, nigga 

Tira beef, pero no dispara 
No es un G, se le ve en la cara
Lo que tengo no son caramelo'
Por eso sabe que el precio nunca baja
Ahora estoy metido en el estudio 
Planto en marzo, corto en junio 
Con mi negro facturando 
Tu puta enterada, quiere estar tumbando 
Y yo no lo digo
Lo dice la calle, ando con la Barbie, mantenete escondido 
Los tengo aprendiendo hasta cuando no escribo, así es como vivo 
Como dice Nicky, la combi completa la tengo tumbando el club 
Entre el barrio y el alcohol 

Guacho' sin nada que contar queriendo presumir 
Papel de colore' y firma' de autore' 
Hasta no tumbar, no no' fuimo' 
My trapper' llevándose el doble del deal 
Mis trap' en el feat son la cara del siglo 
Llegan al club lo' que odian dormir
Y el after del after se hace infinito 
Tumbé la tableta en el tinto 
Dejé a la concheta en el limbo 
Sin Lambo y con amba' bebé' de mi' brazo', de ningún pecado resisto 
Mandó ubicación y me quiere encontrar 
Cartucho' no' sobran para disparar 
La promo e' real, yo sino no le insisto 
Un precio tan bajo, che, nunca había visto 

Eh, ando en la trampa con Tony 
Distribución desde el west 
Hacen que no, but they know me 
No hay llanto pa' lo de ayer, ¿qué, qué, qué?
Actitud y estilo, que tumbamo' el club
Nada de eso es tuyo, así que dámelo
Las ex de mi chico van a verme al show 
¿Quién va a discutir que la jefa soy yo?
Ese logi está batiendo y no el double cup
Yo creo que e' vigilante like RoboCop
Está hablando de mi estilo, de mi tumbao' 
Le puedo tumba' la guacha que tiene al lao' 
Qué lo qué, lo qué, lo que tiene e' miedo
La nena va a quedarse con su trofeo 
Yo te lo avisé, y no me miren feo
Vo' viajando en tren y yo en un trineo
Ice, ice, tengo resuelta la trampa
Bye, bye, eso' negro' no son gangsta
Nice, nice, terminó pidiendo basta
Mucho 
Fast and Furious
, y en meno' 'e la mitad
Todo' ya se quedaron sin nafta 

Y ahora todos tiran beef, yo los vi, son más de dos
Pero eso no es trap, manito, trap es mi negro en prisión
Trap no son tus putas, trap es mi equipo tumbando el club
Tumbando el club, ey , tumbando el club, ey 
Tumbando el club, ey, tumbando el club, ey
Ya saben todos, nos llevamo' el 2026 
Tumbando el club, yeah

Ya saben todo', somo' los nene' pegao' en el game
 

Tumbando el club 'tamo, eh

Me sale ser blessed , pese a quien le pese
Rompemo' lo' party, yeah 
Tumbando el club tamo', yeah 
El cuello 'e hielo rosa'o
Tumba la casa, estamo' 
Mami, ese flow no es copia'o
Tu puta en cuatro me dice: ""Pegao'"" 
La anda buscando, 'tá desesperao' 
Tumbando el club 'tamo 
El nene 'e calle lo hace calla'o

Yo escupo fire, no tengo una forty
Con cara tatuada, es el Duko y el Tony
Entrando a la disco con flow Al Capone
Si quieren el plug, nos tiran un call in
Súbelo, bájalo, que yo entro como siempre
Préndelo y pásalo que ya son cuatro y veinte
Ando en el club, endemoniao' con mi' demente'
Con Tony Montana, padrino, tu referente
Y aunque ellos pregunten por mí, en la calle estoy clean, por mí ya no recen 
Aunque con nada salí, nací pobre, muero rich, no me importa a quién le pese
2016, yo tenía 14, mis negro' tumbaban el club desde entonce'
Blessed de chico, de ustede' yo no sé
0-600, subime las voce'

Fuck esas putas del trap
Sé que les tiembla para disparar
Lo suyo e' vender, lo nuestro e' robar
Free Gordo Valor, fuck Chapo Guzmán
Y yo qué sé, si no entiendo nada 
Fumo pa' olvidar y no pensar nada 
Mejor callate y no me diga' nada 
Guacho, no te zarpe', sé tus coordenada' 
Los guacho' del barrio no consumen molly
Acá hay vino, Pritty y Rivotril
Si Gucci es tu santo, está' equivocado
Acá le rezamo' al Gauchito Gil
Mi cintita roja lista pa' la envidia 
Por si me quiere frenar el civil
Me revisa, no me encuentra nada 
Me río en su cara, ya la consumí, ey 

Que sigo ganando, que sigo rompiendo y partiendo tu club, club, club
Me mira esta guacha, quiere otra cadena, soy Héctor Lavoe-voe-voe 
Siempre te regala, pero digo no
Sólo pa' lo mío yo te digo: ""Sí"" 
Tamo' como nuevo', ¿no me ve', jamón?
Quiere que le firme con mi nombre ahí
Que tamo' en el club, comiendo del club
Viviendo del club, club, club
Con lo' guacho' a full, con la' guacha' a full
Mirate esta crew, you know
Ah, todo' me regalan pero quiero má'
Siempre te lo dije: voy sin trabajar 
Ella no me quiere, no me importa na'
Viene' lo' millone' pa' tumbar el club 

Llego a la disco con un cadenón 
Con cara de nada fumándome un blunt 
Tu puta sabe quién soy 
Sabe que vine a tumbar el club 
No paro 'e mirarla, tiene un caderón 
Le pedí que aguante el calentón 
Su novio no es un matón 
Para mí que es un bobolón , check
Pasao' de ki como Goku 
Con mucha weed, con do' cu 
Si preguntan, tengo el plug
Má' fácil que A-E-I-O-U 
Soy la nota 'e la nota 
Soy la nota 'e la nota 
Lo' mío' le venden a lo' que lo' tuyo' le compran

Llegó el momento de decir la verdad 
Tengo un par de hijos por toda la ciudad 
Simón dice que te ponga a bailar 
Así que mueve tu culo, pull up, pégale al clap 
You bitch, ronroneando en el medio 
Mirá cómo sacude, se parece a un salero 
Please, Southside, quítamelo del medio 
Ya nos cargamos el año, evitense un daño serio, que- 
Están perseguido' 
Me chupan la sangre, parecen vampiros 
Dame dos, disparos que tiro 
Me chupan el flow,
 
ya me tienen podrido 
Estoy cómodo, esos no son trap, nigga, son homeboy' 
Trap no es tu puta girando como un trompo 
Trap es mi negro ahí encerrado, apuñalado con un pedazo de vidrio de un espejo roto 

Y ahora todos tiran beef
Yo los vi, son más de dos
Pero eso no es trap, manito
Trap es mi negro en prisión
Trap no son tus putas
Trap es mi equipo tumbando el club

To take my love away
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Said you won't forget my name
Not today, not tomorrow
Kinda strange, feelin' sorrow
I got change , you could borrow 
When I come back around, will I know what to say?
Not today, maybe tomorrow

Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?

Did you take
My love away
From me? Me
Me

Saw your seat at the counter when I looked away
Saw you turn around, but it wasn't your face
Said, ""I need to be alone now, I'm takin' a break""
How come when I rеturned, you were gonе away?

I don't, I don't know why I called
I don't know you at all
I don't know you
Not at all
I don't, I don't know why I called
I don't know you at all
I don't know you

Did you take
My love away
From me? Me

And that's when you found me

I was waitin' in the garden
Contemplatin', beg your pardon
But there's a part of me that recognizes you
Do you feel it too?
When you told me it was serious
Were you serious? Mm
They told me they were only curious
Now it's serious, mm

Open up the door, can you open up the door?
I know you said before you can't cope with any more
You told me it was war, said you'd show me what's in store
I hope it's not for sure, can you open up the door?

Wringing my hands in my lap
And they tell me it's all been a trap
And you don't know if you'll make it back
I said, ""No, don't say that""

Said I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to
I don't gotta dance

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""
These expensive, these is red bottoms, these is bloody shoes
Hit the store, I can get 'em both, I don't wanna choose
And I'm quick, cut a nigga off, so don't get comfortable, look
I don't dance now, I make money moves 
Say I don't gotta dance, I make money move
If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

Now she say she gon' do what to who? Let's find out and see
Cardi B, you know where I'm at, you know where I be
You in the club just to party, I'm there, I get paid a fee
I be in and out them banks so much, I know they're tired of me
Honestly, don't give a fuck 'bout who ain't fond of me
Dropped two mixtapes in six months
What bitch working as hard as me?
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
They see pictures, they say, ""Goals,"" bitch, I'm who they tryna be
Look, I might just chill in some BAPE
I might just chill with your boo, I might just feel on your babe
My pussy feel like a lake
He wanna swim with his face, I'm like, ""Okay""
I'll let him get what he want, he buy me Yves Saint Laurent
And the new whip, when I go fast as a horse
I got the trunk in the front 
I'm the hottest in the street, know you prolly heard of me
Got a bag and fixed my teeth, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
And I pay my mama bills, I ain't got no time to chill
Think these hoes be mad at me, their baby father run a bill

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""

If I see you and I don't speak, that means I don't fuck with you
I'm a boss, you a worker, bitch, I make bloody moves

If you a pussy, you get popped, you a goofy, you a opp
Don't you come around my way, you can't hang around my block
And I just checked my accounts, turns out, I'm rich, I'm rich, I'm rich
I put my hand above my hip, I bet you dip, he dip, she dip
I say I get the money and go, this shit is hot like a stove
My pussy glitter is gold, tell that lil' bitch play her role
I just arrove in a Rolls, I just came up in a Wraith
I need to fill up the tank, no, I need to fill up the safe
I need to let all these hoes know that none of their niggas is safe
I go to dinner and steak, only the real can relate
I used to live in the P's, now it's a crib with a gate
Rollie got charms, look like Frosted Flakes
Had to let these bitches know, just in case these hoes forgot
I just run and check the mail, another check from Mona Scott

Said, ""Lil' bitch, you can't fuck with me if you wanted to""

Fairytale Of New York,"['The Pogues', 'Kirsty MacColl']","
It was Christmas Eve, babe
In the drunk tank
An old man said to me
""Won't see another one""
And then he sang a song
'The Rare Old Mountain Dew'
I turned my face away
And dreamed about you
Got on a lucky one
Came in eighteen-to-one
I've got a feeling
This year's for me and you
So, Happy Christmas
I love you, baby
I can see a better time
When all our dreams come true

They've got cars big as bars, they've got rivers of gold
But the wind goes right through you, it's no place for the old
When you first took my hand on a cold Christmas Eve
You promised me Broadway was waiting for me
You were handsome
, 
you were pretty, queen of New York City
When the band finished playing, they howled out for more
Sinatra was swinging
, all the drunks, they were singing
We kissed on a corner, then danced through the night

The boys of the NYPD choir
 
were singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells were ringing out for Christmas Day

You're a bum, you're a punk, 
you're an old slut on junk
Lying there almost dead on a drip in that bed
You scumbag, you maggot, 
you cheap, lousy faggot
Happy Christmas, your arse,
 
I pray God it's our last

The boys of the NYPD choir,
 
still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out for Christmas Day

""I could have been someone"", 
well, so could anyone
You took my dreams from me when I first found you
I kept them with me, babe, I put them with my own
Can't make it all alone, I've built my dreams around you

still singing ""Galway Bay""
And the bells are ringing out for Christmas Day"

Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But the fire is so delightful
And since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow

Man, it doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought me some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

And the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, and snow

When we finally kiss goodnight
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really grab me tight
All the way home I'll be warm

Oh, the fire is slowly dying
And, my dear, we're still goodbyeing
But as long as you love me so
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow"

The whole world stops and stares for a while

Viva La Vida,['Coldplay'],"
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the mornin', I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
""Now the old king is dead, long live the king""
One minute, I held the key
Next, the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
Once you'd gone, there was never
Never an honest word
And that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become
Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string 
Aw, who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringin'
Roman cavalry choirs are singin'
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field
For some reason, I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Hate to see you happy if I'm not the one drivin'

I might kill my ex, not the best idea
His new girlfriend's next, how'd I get here?
I might kill my ex, I still love him though
Rather be in jail than alone

I get the sense that it's a lost cause
I get the sense that you might really love her
This text gon' be evidence, this text is evidence
I tried to ration with you, no murders or crime of passion, but damn
You was out of reach
You was at the farmer's market with your perfect peach
Now I'm in the basement plannin' home invasion

The most famous reindeer of all?
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

Had a very shiny nose

And if you ever saw it

You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer

Used to laugh and call him names

They never let poor Rudolph

Play in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say

Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight?
Then how the reindeer loved him

As they shouted out with glee

Flowers,['Miley Cyrus'],"
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, ""Don't you cry when you're down""
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""

I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, ""Hallelujah, you're home""






Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, ""Hallelujah, you're home"""

Stick Season,['Noah Kahan'],"
As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined
You must've had yourself a change of heart like halfway through the drive
Because your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign
Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right

And memories are somethin' even
 
smoking weed does not replace
And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains
Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad
That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from Dad
No, I am no longer funny 'cause I miss the way you laugh
You once called me ""forever,"" now you still can't call me back

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do

Oh, that'll have to do
My other half was you
I hope this pain's just passin' through
But I doubt it

And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks
And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed
And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim
I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas
And I'll dream each night of some version of you
That I might not have, but I did not lose
Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes
And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do
Have to do"
"Baby, It's Cold Outside",['Dean Martin'],"
I really can't stay 

I've got to go away 

This evening has been 

So very nice 

My mother will start to worry 

My father will be pacing the floor 

So, really, I'd better scurry 

But maybe just a half a drink more 

The neighbors might think 

Say, what's in this drink? 

I wish I knew how 

To break this spell 

I ought to say, ""No, no, no, sir"" 

At least I'm gonna say that I tried 


I really can't stay

Baby, it's cold outside

I simply must go 

The answer is no 

Your welcome has been 

So nice and warm 

My sister will be suspicious 

My brother will be there at the door 

My maiden aunt's mind is vicious 

But maybe just a cigarette more 

I've gotta get home 

Say, lend me a coat 

You've really been grand 

But don't you see? 

There's bound to be talk tomorrow 

At least there will be plenty implied 


I really can't stay

Baby, it's cold
Baby, it's cold outside"

Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty

This that pretty-girl mantra,
 
this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A.​
Pretty girls don't do drama 'less we wanna, it'll be depending on the day
Pretty girls packed in a Defender,
 
know I'ma defend her, never let her catch no stray
This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, make you wanna swing both ways

Mix me with the drama 
Check you like commas 
My clothes are pajamas 
Straight from the cold plunge 
Daytime baddie use her mind
Quick switch of the fit for the night 
Swеrvin' through the lane, we'll bе twenty minute late
'Cause we had to do an In-N-Out drive-by

It's not that deep , I'm not that drunk 
Sometimes, girls just gotta have fun
Throw it back, all that ass
Me and my sis, way too attached
It's not that deep , we're not that dumb 
Look at them Bonnies on the run
Inside glowin' like the sun 
You're gonna feel this every day 

This that pretty-girl mantra,
 
this that flaunt ya, just touched down in L.A.​
Pretty girls don't do drama 'less we wanna, it'll be depending on the day
Pretty girls packed in a Defender,

This that pretty-girl mantra, she's that stunna, make you wanna swing both ways

Love what it feel like 
To be off of the grid like all night
Oh, with my bih, like 
We ain't even tryna talk no one
Swerve off all the creeps, no weird vibes
We ain't never let it ruin a good time
Ain't nobody gon' dim our good light
This them words we're livin' by

Perfect,['Ed Sheeran'],"
I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me

'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, ""Darlin', you look perfect tonight""

Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own

We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight

No, no, no
Mm, no, no

Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight"
Numb,['Linkin Park'],"

Hello? 
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone home?
Come on , now
I hear you're feeling down
Well, I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax 
I'll need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am

I have become comfortably numb


I have become comfortably numb

Okay 
Just a little pinprick
There'll be no more
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up? 
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move, but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child, I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look, but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown, the dream is gone

I have become comfortably numb

Nights Like This,['The Kid LAROI'],"
You act like you need remindin'
Tryna do it over, bring it back and rewind it
But all that glitters isn't gold, I was blinded
Should have never gave you my heart on consignment

And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya
Can you tell me what's with all this distant love?
If I called, would you pick it up?
On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no 

All them times I played the fool for you
Thinkin' we could put it back together, thought we had forever
You never see my point of view
Our connection is so severed, you don't show no effort

And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though
Took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

On some nights like this, shawty, I can't help but think of us
I've been reminiscin', sippin', missin' ya

On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no 

You gon' get my hopes high, girl
You gon' get my hopes high, girl
Just gon' tell me more lies, girl
Just gon' get my hopes high, girl

I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, ""Hit my line""
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin'
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but...

On some nights like this

There's a way
There's a way that we can fly again
Remember how we used to love back then?
Livin' like we had no end
Let's stay out all night
Out all night until we see the sun
Remember how we used to long ago
We can miss the last train home?

Don't you let our love go cold
When we're standing still
We can light it up once more
I'll take you there

We'll be running wild
Lovin' 'til the sun is out
Running 'til there's nothin' left
'Til our last breath
We'll be running wild
Lovin' like it's made for us
Running 'til there’s nothin' left
'Til our last breath
We’ll be running wild

Don't forget
Don't forget about the times we shared
All the places that we used to go
Livin' like we've ruled the world

Don't you let our love go cold
When we're standing still
We can light it up once more
I'll take you there

We'll be running wild
Lovin' 'til the sun is out
Running 'til there's nothin' left
'Til our last breath
We'll be running wild
Lovin' like it's made for us
Running 'til there’s nothin' left

Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta 
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, them the shottas 
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta 

Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', ""Rest in peace to Bon Scott"" 
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison 
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car 
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', ""I'm with the band"" 
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend 

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta

When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grra-ta-ta-ta 

I've been in the Hills fuckin' superstars
Feelin' like a popstar 
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool
And they ain't got on no bra 
Hit her from the back, pullin' on her tracks
And now she screamin' out, ""¡No más!"" 
They like, ""Savage, why you got a twelve car garage
And you only got six cars?"" 
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? 
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack 
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks 
L.A. bitches always askin', ""Where the coke at?"" 
Livin' like a rockstar, smash out on a cop car
Sweeter than a Pop-Tart, you know you are not hard
I done made the hot chart, 'member I used to trap hard
Livin' like a rockstar, I'm livin' like a rockstar 

I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm goin' through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey

I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh

The city's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

I'm just calling back to let you know 
I could never say it on the phone 
Will never let you go this time 

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey

Hey, hey, hey

I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights

Ey, con la verdad se llega lejos
Súbela, súbele a mi voz ahí, un pelín
Ey, en ninguna

""Cuídese de la envidia, mijo""
Mirándome a los ojos, mi vieja, descanse en paz ya, una vez me dijo
Y qué razón tenía al advertirme de esta vida puerca
No críes cuervos, o arrancarán tus ojos de sus cuencas

Me he dado cuenta que la verdad es tan relativa
Y la realidad es tanta mentira...
Perros tratando de invadir mi propiedad privá' mientras dormía
Buscando robar mis hembras, mis reales, mi comida
""Maldito sea el hombre que confía en otro hombre""
Qué gran verdad en esa frase se esconde
Me siento como un loco al tratar de confiar yo todavía
En alguien, en el planeta de la hipocresía
¡Válgame, soy un iluso! Tan bravo que me la doy y el abuso
Es natural que en contra de mí den uso
Mundo sucio donde todos piensan solo en ellos mismos
Malditos mil veces, títeres del egoísmo
Esta es pa' ti, pa' ti, tú que me traicionaste a mí
Me das la mano, con tu cara 'e ""Yo no fui""
Y yo inocente te la di porque todavía no sabía
Que tu risita venía con la fecha ya vencía'
Esta canción no es para nadie
Que no tenga ganas de matar a alguien por falso y coño 'e su madre
Otra mano con puñal en mi dorsal
La mano de un tal carnal, hermano que mi mano solía estrechar
El más traidor puede que lo tengas de frente
Bebiendo tus frías, o compartiendo tu cena caliente
Ojalá se ahoguen los que siempre mienten
Y una vez en el infierno, que se quemen para siempre
¿Nunca habías pensado que tu socio puede ser un sucio
Que por un negocio te puede dar chuzo?
Mi brazo me dice que el amor me llevará lejos
Pero el odio me enseñó a ser un lince, nunca un pendejo
Con los dedos de una mano eran contados
Los que esa misma mano por ellos metía al fuego
Ahora por un zamuro en traje de cordero, Canserbero
Está pensando en tener que volarse un deo'
Por eso ya no creo ni en mi almohada
Ni en mi sombra, o sea en nada
¡Ni siquiera creo en mi viejo!
Si algún día te digo que te creo, no me creas que te creo
Porque ya, no creo ni en mi reflejo
Si buscas una mano amiga empieza por tu brazo
Eso lo supe a punta de coñazos
Ojalá mi vida sea larga pa' ver cuando la tuya fracase
Y pisar tu mano cuando me pidas que te alce, mi parce

Soy simplemente inexpresivo, cuando escribo
Ya casi no bebo ron, sino vino y de corazón digo
Que la sucia venganza mata el alma y la envenena
Pero cuando de traición se trata sí vale la pena
La palabra vale, la trampa sale
Los varoncitos se ven a los ojos para decir verdades
Déjala colá' cuando pierdas batalla, que esa no es la guerra
Y si alguna te falla, cámbiala por perra
Pon de mierda la sangre, de piedra el corazón
Súbele volumen, repíteme la oración
""Maldito sea el hombre que confía en otro hombre""
Los que traicionaron, recuerda sus caras y sus nombres
Solo hay una cosa en ti que admiro
Y es que, ¿cómo siendo tan dos caras puedes todavía dormir tranquilo?
Por mi parte, bien, yo sonrío
Pero por mi madre, que no es bueno tener al Canserbero de enemigo
El barrio no pasó en vano
Como Willie Colón en el profundo de mi corazón soy malo
Estos malditos cagapalos piensan que yo no estoy claro
Que no son unos coño 'e madres mis hermanos
Yo soy la vida y la muerte, 
y no creo en nada
Ni en leyendas vivas, ni en leyendas muertas, ni resucitadas
Yo soy real como Bolívar y su espada
Dándole puñaladas a los hipócritas por sus fachadas
Me sabe a mierda, cultura, putas y fama
Esta canción no es pa' que pegue, ya tiene verdad pegada
Vivirás trauma cuando no tengas panas
Y notes que las que te dicen que te aman me miran con ganas
Me sabe a culo el flow y las habilidades
Yo soy tosco, no me salen rimas que no sean reales
Dios quiera no te encuentres a González afuera
Y te invite una cancha hasta que alguno de los dos se muera
Un coño e' madre, caballero, ¿verdad?
Si puedo, te apuñalo hasta con el lápiz que usé pa'l tema
Farsantes, hay más que moscas donde te cagaste
O mal olor donde measte, ¿sin metáforas? Bastante
Una mano te corta la otra, como dijo Tempo
Y las acciones no se las lleva el viento
Que te perdone Cristo si existe
Porque si por mí, puedo cantar esto mientras meo en tu tumba triste
Que suba la mano el que no crea en nadie
Y si nadie la sube, la subo yo
Ojalá te mueras, antiguo compadre
Y nos veamos en el infierno pa' volverte a matar yo

Dios no puede duplicarme lo que pienso cuando te observo
Porque más de una vez no puedo entrar al infierno
Y a mí no me digas ""tu hermano"" que pa' ti soy Canserbero
Rolitronco 'e mamagüevo

Seven,"['Jung Kook', 'Latto']","
All the world’s a stage,
And all the men and women merely players;
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages.
 
At first the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms;
And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school
. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, 
with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress’ eyebrow.
 
Then a soldier,
Full of strange oaths, 
and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor,
 sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon’s mouth. 
And then the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lined,
With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose 
and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, 
a world too wide
For his shrunk shank;
 
and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound.
 
Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen
And let him feed..."
Cozy Little Christmas,['Katy Perry'],"
Everybody's in a hurry, in a flurry
Shopping 'til they're droppin' in the snow
Kids are cryin', dogs are barkin'
Catchin' up with folks we barely know
Sure, it's madness, but it's magic
As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
'Cause you're the reason for the season
No, we don't need to keep up with the Jones

Our love is something priceless

I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things 
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling 
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

So, Mr. Santa 
Take the day off 
Get a massage 
'Cause we've got this one all under control
A little whiskey 
We're getting frisky 
And slow dancing to Nat King Cole
No, we ain't stressin' 
Just caressin' 
Warming up our popsicle toes
Nothing's missin' 
'Cause you're a blessin' 
Yeah, you're the only one I'm wishing for

Our love is something priceless

I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things 
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling 
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

I don't need anything
Take back all the Cartier, and the Tiffany's and the Chanel
Well, can I keep that Chanel? Please?
No, no, no, no

I don't need diamonds, no sparkly things 
'Cause you can't buy this a-feeling 
Nothing lights my fire or wraps me up, baby, like you do
Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you


Just you and me, under a tree

A cozy little Christmas here with you"

Miren, ¿quién lo pensaría? El muchacho se fue pa' arriba
Le sobra la calidad, de varias la ha librado andando en la patrulla
Las ganas de superarme por las noches me perturban
Sigo siendo el mismo, solo que cambie los planes y los medios zumban
Y de repente nos vamos de rumba
Porque hoy se puede hacer lo que me gusta
Los doble cara me caen en la punta
Y lo peor del caso que de esos abundan

Me muero si tú no estás
Véngase pa' acá, mi nena, mamá
Véngase, márqueme a mi celular
Te quiero acariciar y tu pelo rozar

Así nomás, compa Neton, pa' que sepan, viejo
Y así suena la Doble P, viejillo
Jálese la greña

Todo le he aprendido al viejo, bien firmes con su bandera
Prohibido decir su nombre, da la vuelta al mundo y en su jet despega
Siente el peligro y la Glock desenfunda
No digo el nombre por si se preguntan
Uno de uva aquí me vo'a prender
De varias la ha librado andando en la patrulla

Me muero si tú no estás
Véngase pa' acá, mi nena, mamá
Llámame, márcame a mi celular
Te quiero acariciar y tu pelo rozar"

Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years, we all will be together

Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

The love and hate is definite without a cure
All this talk is bitch-made, that's on my Lord
I'll kill 'em all before I let 'em kill my joy
I done been through it all, what you endure?
It used to be fuck that nigga, but now it's plural
Fuck everybody, that's on my body
My blick first, then God got me
I watch 'em pandеr with them back-handed compliments
Put thеy head on a Cuban link as a monument
I paid homage and I always mind my business
I made the—
I never lost who I am for a rap image
It's motivation if you wonder how I did it

Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank
Know you a god even when they say you ain't
Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way
Never let no one put smut up on your name
Yeah, nigga, keep your head down and work like I do
But understand everybody ain't gon' like you
Yeah, nigga, if they say it's love, you've been lied to
A couple rules of engagements, I'ma guide you

Que refleja en tu mirada
La noche, tú y yo

Ridin' in my GNX with Anita Baker in the tape deck, it's gon' be a sweet love
Fuck apologies, I wanna see y'all geeked up
Don't acknowledge me, then maybe we can say it's fair
Take it to the internet and I'ma take it there
Miss my uncle Lil' Mane, he said that he would kill me if I didn't make it
Now I'm possessed by a spirit and they can't take it
Used to bump 
Tha Carter III

Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down
Whatever, though, call me crazy, everybody questionable
Turn me to an eskimo, I drew the line and decimals
Snoop posted ""Taylor Made,"" I prayed it was the edibles
I couldn't believe it, it was only right for me to let it go
Won the Super Bowl and Nas the only one congratulate me
All these niggas agitated, I'm just glad they showin' they faces
Quite frankly, plenty artists, but they outdated
Old-ass flows, tryna convince me that you they favorite
This is not for lyricists, I swear it's not the sentiments
Fuck a double entendre, I want y'all to feel this shit
Old soul, bitch, I probably built them pyramids
Ducking strays when I rap battled in the Nickersons
Where you from? Not where I'm from, we all indigenous
Against all odds, I squabbled up for them dividends
Against all odds, I showed up as a gentleman
I done lost plenty friends, sixteen to be specific
Put that on my kids' children, we gon' see the future first
They like, ""Dot big trippin',"" I just want what I deserve
What bridge they done burnt? All of them, it's over with

Niggas from my city couldn't entertain old boy
Promisin' bank transactions and even bitcoin
I never peaced it up, that shit don't sit well with me
Before I take a truce, I'll take 'em to Hell with me
If that money got in the hands of a crash dummy
Could jeopardize my family and burden the ones who love me
Niggas mad 'cause I decided not to pretend
Y'all stay politically correct, I'ma do what I did
Ain't no sympathy here, this shit's hilarious
It's a lot of opinions, but no power to carry it
2025, they still movin' on some scary shit
Tell 'em quit they job and pay the real niggas they severance
Don't insult my intelligence, I'm not just for the television
Teleport to Bullis Road and dig up all my relatives
Okay, nigga, let's settle it, these niggas been fake loyal
Since y'all pandering to choose a side, let me do it for you
Okay, fuck your hip-hop, I watched the party just die
Niggas cackling about— while all of y'all is on trial
Niggas thought that I was antisocial when I stayed inside of my house
You better off to have one woman, everything tricky right now
You niggas live in denial
Ayy, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow
A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with 'em in style
Exterminate 'em right now
Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth 'bout to get loud
No juice inside of my cup, I sober up and knock 'em all off
Don't let no white comedian talk about no Black woman, that's law
I know propaganda work for them, and fuck whoever that's close to them
The niggas that coon, the niggas that bein' groomed, slide on both of them
You ever ate Cap'n Crunch and proceeded to pour water in it?
Pulled over by the law, you ridin' dirty, so you can't argue with 'em?
Then make it to be a star, bare your soul and put your heart up in it?
Well, I did

You know the last one figured he was Magneto
You play God, you gon' get what you ask for
We got the same twenty-four, what you mad for?

It's high beams if I make a public appearance
Go back to hidin' 'cause I'm not too friendly with niggas

Every night's another reason why I left it all

I thank my wicked dreams, a year from Tennessee
Oh, Santa Monica, you've been too good to me
Won't make my mama proud, it's gonna cause a scene

Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back



I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating 
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on 
MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits 

Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel
, 
so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in,
 and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, 
the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
 
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy 
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me

Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me

Just a small-town girl, livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
Just a city boy, born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

A singer in a smoky room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile, they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some are born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waitin'
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searchin' in the night
Streetlights, people
Livin' just to find emotion
Hidin' somewhere in the night

When you were here before, couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel, your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather in a beautiful world
I wish I was special
, 
you're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts, I wanna have control
I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice when I'm not around
You're so fuckin' special, I wish I was special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doin' here?

Oh-oh, oh-oh

Geah.. whassup?
To all my street niggas, project niggas
Real niggas, worldwide
Let's reflect, everybody got a story
We all ghetto B, here's mine
Geah

See I was, born in sewage, born to make bomb music
Flow tight like I was born Jewish
Used the streets as a conduit
I kept arms .38 longs inside my mom's Buick
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news
Iron cuffs - arms through it, or stuffed with embalming fluid
Shit, I'm going through it - mom dukes too
Tears streaming down her pretty face, she got her palms to it
My life is getting too wild
I need to bring some sort of calm to it
Bout to lose it voices screaming ""Don't do it!""
It's like '93, '94,
 
'bout the year
That Big and Mack dropped and 
Illmatic
 rocked
Outta every rag drop, 
and the West had it locked
Everybody doing them, 
I'm still stretching on the block
Like ""Damn, I'ma be a failure""
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug paraphernalia
Cops, courts, and their thoughts is to derail us
Three-time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts
Trying to figure where your mail is
Guesstimate the weight you selling
So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!
It gets worse, baby momma water burst
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be soon

This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us

Chill dog
Second oldest born, from Michelle Brown my mother
Hell bound, grew with two sisters and one brother
Pop wasn't around, so many stories that's another
I'm thinking ""Damn, how my older sister gon' make me tougher?""
When steel sharpens steel, I'ma keep it real
I'm tired of trying to hide my pain behind the syrups and pills
Dead to the world, stretched out like a corpse for real
Y'all niggas thinking what y'all reading in 
The Source
 is real
What my life like, you looking at the source, it's real
What your life like? Mine dog, of course it's real
Passing judgment, you niggas second-guessing Beans
'Cause you don't eat swine don't make you Mu'min
Dog you know a couple suras, out the Qur'an
I guess you all on your din and I ain't on mine
Stop that 
Akki
, 'fore I send shots through your body
Make 'em feel 
hell on earth
 before Allah drop me
I feel the line's drawn here, nutting more can stop me
'Til them feds pick me up, or them boys pop me
There's only three things that make Mack not act like Beans
Amatullah Tisha, Po Aldin, Samir Amin
My seeds dog, 
gotta teach 'em that before I leave, dog
Shit I know that I'ma see 'em when I leave, dog
I come back in the afterlife
Like fuck it, I done touched hell twice; what's the meaning?

Life.. yeah.. uhh..
Now as I walk into the studio to do this with Jig'
I got a phone call from one of my nigs
Said my homeboy Reek, he just lost one of his kids
And when I heard that I just broke into tears
And see in the second hand; you don't really know how this is
But when it hits that close to home you feel the pain at the crib
So I called mine, and saddened my wife with the bad news
Now we both depressed, counting our blessings 'cause Brad's two
Praying for young souls to laugh at life through the stars
Loving your kids just like you was ours
And I'm hurting for you dog; but ain't nobody pain is like yours
I just know that heaven'll open these doors
And ain't no bright side to losing life; but you can view it like this
God's got open hands homie, he in the midst
Of good company, who loves all and hates not one
And one day you gon' be with your son
I could've rapped about my hard times on this song
But heaven knows I woulda been wrong
I wouldn'ta been right, it wouldn'ta been love
It wouldn'ta been life, it wouldn'ta been us
This can't be life

This can't be life, this can't be love
This can't be right, there's gotta be more, this can't be us
This can't be life, this can't be love

What Is This Feeling?,"['Ariana Grande', 'Cynthia Erivo']","
Dearest, darlingest Momsie and Popsicle

My dear father

There's been some confusion over rooming here at Shiz

But of course, I'll care for Nessa

But of course, I'll rise above it

For I know that's how you'd want me to respond, yes
There's been some confusion for, you see, my roommate is

Unusually and exceedingly peculiar
And altogether quite impossible to describe

Blonde

What is this feeling, so sudden, and new?

I felt the moment I laid eyes on you

My pulse is rushing

My head is reeling

My face is flushing

What is this feeling?
Fervid as a flame
Does it have a name?
Yes
Loathing
Unadulterated loathing

For your face

Your voice

Your clothing

Let's just say
I loathe it all
Every little trait, however small
Makes my very flesh begin to crawl
With simple, utter loathing
There's a strange exhilaration
In such total detestation
It's so pure, so strong
Though I do admit, it came on fast
Still, I do believe that it can last
And I will be loathing
Loathing you my whole life long

Dear Galinda, you are just too good
How do you stand it? I don't think I could
She's a terror, she's a Tartar,
 
we don't mean to show a bias
But, Galinda, you're a martyr

Well, these things are sent to try us

Poor Galinda, forced to reside
With someone so disgusticified
We just want to tell you, we're all on your side
We share your loathing

What is this feeling, so sudden and new?

Unadulterated loathing

I felt the moment I laid eyes on you

For her face, her voice, her clothing

My pulse is rushing, my head is reeling 

We loathe it all

Oh, what is this feeling?

Every little trait, however small

Does it have a name?

Makes our very flesh begin to crawl

Yes

Ah

Loathing

Loathing

There's a strange exhilaration

Loathing

In such total detestation

Loathing

It's so pure, so strong

So strong

Though I do admit, it came on fast
Still, I do believe that it can last

And I will be 
loathing
 for forever
Loathing
 truly deeply
Loathing
 you 

My whole life long

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
I need somebody to hear,  somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody to hold
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to hear
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape

Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around

For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all

It's the holiday season

So hoop-dee-doo and dickory dock
And don't forget to hang up your sock
'Cause just exactly at 12 o'clock
He'll be coming down the chimney, down


He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
And lots of goodies for you and for me
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
Hanging on the Christmas tree

It's the holiday season

So hoop-dee-doo and dickory dock
And don't forget to hang up your sock
'Cause at just exactly at 12 o'clock
He'll be coming down the chimney
Coming down the chimney
Coming down the chimney, down

He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
And lots of goodies for you and me
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
Hanging on the Christmas tree

It's the holiday season
So hoop-dee-doo and hickory dock
And don't forget to hang up your sock
'Cause just exactly at 12 o'clock
He'll be coming down the chimney
Coming down the chimney
Coming down the chimney, down

He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
And lots of goodies for you and me
So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
Hanging on the Christmas tree

Happy holiday
Happy holiday
While the merry bells keep ringing
Happy holidays to you
Happy holiday
Happy holiday
May the calendar keep bringing
Happy holidays to you
To you
Happy holiday

Guess,"['Charli xcx', 'Billie Eilish']","
Hey, Billie, you there?
Uh-uh

You wanna guess the colour of my underwear
You wanna know what I got goin' on down there
Is it pretty in pink or all see-through?
Is it showin' off my brand-new lower-back tattoo?
You wanna put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what I'm talkin' about
Pu-pu-pu-put 'em in your mouth, pull 'em all down south
You wanna turn this shit out, that's what l'm talkin' about 

Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Send 'em to The Dare, yeah, I think he's with it
Try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Wear 'em, post 'em, might remix it
Eat it up for lunch, yeah, it's so delicious


Don't have to guess the color of your underwear
Already know what you've got goin' on down there
It's that lacy black pair with the little bows
The ones I picked out for you in Tokyo
I saw them when you sat down, they were peekin' out
I'm gonna tell you right now, they're all I'm thinkin' about

I wanna try it, bite it, lick it, spit it
Pull it to the side and get all up in it
Kiss it, ride it, can I fit it?
Charli likes boys, but she knows I'd hit it

Charli, call me if you're with it

Fortnight,"['Taylor Swift', 'Post Malone']","
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an 
endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the 
effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you
, but I touched you

And for a fortnight there, 
we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask 
about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned 
into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight there, 
we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you

Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up

Winter Ahead,['V With Park Hyo Shin'],"

Lie with me
By the fire
We can be
Safe from the storms up high
There's a winter ahead
If it's cold and wet
We're always warm here, side by side

Come what may
Change of heart
Who can say
If you look in my eyes
For the moon and the stars
Hearing strumming guitars
Well, I admit that it'd be nice

I'll be with you
Until the spring runs by
And the summer starts to burn
I'll be with you
When the autumn wind returns
Don't you want to say you'll stay?

Lie with me
By the fire
We can be
Safe from the storms up high
There's a winter ahead
Whether it's cold and wet
We're always warm in paradise
Paradise


I'll be with you
Until the spring runs by
And the summer starts to burn
And I'll be with you
When autumn returns
Yes, when all the seasons turn

Come what may
Change of heart
Who can say
If you look in my eyes
For the truth in my heart
From a world far apart
You'll realize where you can find
Paradise, mmm
Paradise"

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if, after all these years, you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healin'
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side 
I must've called a thousand times 
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside 
At least, I can say that I've tried 
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

 Ooh, anymore
 Ooh, anymore
 Ooh, anymore
 Anymore

Hello from the other side 
I must've called a thousand times 
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside 
At least, I can say that I've tried 
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

She don't wanna strip no more, don't wanna hit that pole 
Hit my old plug, I get it in and go 
Shawty owe me something, better pay your toll 
I lick the spoon and I scrape the bowl 
Scrape the bowl , scrape the bowl 

Like, did you get the memo?
She eat at out of the relay
I'm poppin' hella Skittles
Then I can solve your riddle
We'll smoke you like it's menthol
This dude is crazy mental
A suave, hood hеro
Got Johnny Dang dental
She's a nympho
She slobbin' on hеr pillow
Got chicken, Rob' De Niro
She's too gone and she can't hear you 

She don't wanna strip no more, don't wanna hit that pole
Hit my old plug, I get it in and go
She don't wanna strip no more, don't wanna hit that pole 
Hit my old plug, I get it in and go 
Shawty owe me something, better pay your toll 
I lick the spoon and I scrape the bowl 
Scrape the bowl , scrape the bowl 

Seein' way too many ones
I'm 'bout to throw some hundreds
 
In that old life that you run from
Baby girl, keep running 
It's pressure with me, sexually 
Check my bank account , it's precious to me
I got my anchor out , I'm locked in your sea
You know you're my baby now, you're special to me
I bought you time, I bought you diamonds, you can keep the receipt
I got you down, I got you loose, I guess you owe it to me
Is you down or nah? Fuck around, find your spot
I get you lit, lit, drunk, trip
Watch me slip inside

She don't wanna strip no more, don't wanna hit that pole 
Hit my old plug, I get it in and go 
Shawty owe me something, better pay your toll 
I lick the spoon and I scrape the bowl 
Scrape the bowl , scrape the bowl 

And I sent her away
Pull out, sent her on her way
She don't wanna hit the strip club, no, no
She don't wanna go strip, no, no
She don't wanna go strip, no way"
I Remember Everything,"['Zach Bryan', 'Kacey Musgraves']","
Rotgut whiskey's gonna ease my mind
Beach towel rests on the dryin' line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hangin' out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat-down basement couch?
I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about
How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything

A cold shoulder at closing time
You were bеggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strangе words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you

You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind
But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?
You're like concrete feet in the summer heat
It burns like hell when two souls meet
No, you'll never be the man that you always swore
But I'll remember you singin' in that '88 Ford

A cold shoulder at closing time
You were beggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'

Gervonta,['Peso Pluma'],"


Pura doncella que le gusta portarse mal
Y una morena que no se sabe comportar
Gloss y labial, anda high, de la Fly prendí un gallo
Cómo pez en el agua, andamos todos bajo el radar
Un italiano que me mueve por la ciudad
Modo Al Capone, mafiosón y en Japón turisteando

Criptomonedas me llegan
Y en primera fila viendo a Gervonta en Las Vegas
Brillando, reloj suizo en la muñeca
Y en jet privado porque el tiempo vuela


Morras en jacuzzi, los plebes con Uzi y SCAR
Más fiestas privadas, Marca Registrada, papá
Pa' parrandear, molly y wax, tropical tronó el foco
Encapuchado, camellando allá por Dubái
Vale verga el qué digan, malgastamos, ya lo dirán
Como Aladdín, volando en el Jeep
Cuerno Duvalín, va de pasajero

Criptomonedas me llegan
Y en primera fila viendo a Gervonta en Las Vegas
Brillando, reloj suizo en la muñeca
Y en jet privado porque el tiempo vuela

 I'm watching it fall
 Lots of people around
 Baby, please come home

 The church bells in town
 All ringing in song
 Full of happy sounds
 Baby, please come home

They're singing ""Deck the Halls""
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

 Pretty lights on the tree
 I'm watching them shine
 You should be here with me
 Baby, please come home

They're singing ""Deck the Halls""
But it's not like Christmas at all
'Cause I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year

 If there was a way
 I'd hold back this tear
 But it's Christmas day

Taking my sulkin' to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain! You made me a, you made me a

Pain! You break me down, you build me up

Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…

Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

By the grace of the fire and the flames
You're the face of the future

The blood in my veins, oh-ooh

Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like…

Christmas Tree Farm,['Taylor Swift'],"
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and 
blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas 

Under the mistletoe 
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""

Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas 
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas

Where every wish comes true

That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still, I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me 
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, all ends here 
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life, immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out of melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs 
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life, immortality"
I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus,['Jackson 5'],"
Oooh, oooh

I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom fast asleep
Then, I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night

Será la magia que tienen tus ojos y esos truquitos para enamorar
Tú me seduces a tu antojo y de tu hechizo no puedo escapar
Qué ganas tengo de buscarte y de volverte a besar 
Por más que traten de alejarte, baby, hoy conmigo tú te vas


Escápate conmigo 

 esta noche, bebé 

Te quiero comer 

, te va a encantar 

Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien 

Te quiero comer 

, tus labios besar 


Bebé, no digas que no 
Si sólo somos tú y yo 
Y se te eriza la piel 
Cuando entramos en calor
Bebé, no digas que no
 
Si sólo somos tú y yo
 
Si se te eriza la piel

Señores, la poderosa

Mi supernova , la que una sonrisa me roba
Tremenda loba, sólo un beso y calienta la alcoba
Se me pega y me soba, no se incomoda
La baby es una pantera, yo soy su casanova 
Escápate conmigo , donde no haya testigos 
Si te preguntan, diles que soy tu mejor amigo 
Yo quiero un beso, tú quieres castigo
Sabes que no te obligo
Te deseo, siempre te lo digo


Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé
Te quiero comer, te va a encantar 

Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien 

Te quiero comer 

, tus labios besar


Es que yo quiero un poco más 
De tu rica desnudez 
Es que el sudor de tu piel 
Es el que yo quiero probar 
Es que yo quiero un poco más 
De tu rica desnudez 
Es que el sudor de tu piel 
Es el que yo quiero probar
Baby, andamos con los poderes
Ozuna

Mi mente descontrola
Y si la llamo, ella me dice que la busque, que está sola
Que no hay tiempo, pero haciéndolo no se demora 

Y si le fallo, que tranquilo, porque no se enamora
Tranquila, la vida conmigo te la vacilas
Que no he visto otra baby de tu liga
Esos besitos que me dan ganas
De amanecer contigo todas las mañanas


Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé 
Te quiero comer , te va a encantar
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar

Bebé, no digas que no 
Si sólo somos tú y yo 
Y se te eriza la piel 
Cuando entramos en calor

Something In The Orange,['Zach Bryan'],"
It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all

And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home

To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights 
around"
Heavy Is The Crown,['Linkin Park'],"
It's pourin' in, you're laid on the floor again
One knock at the door and then
We both know how the story ends
You can't win if your white flag's out when the war begins
Aimin' so high but swingin' so low
Tryin' to catch fire but feelin' so cold
Hold it inside and hope it won't show
I'm sayin' it's not, but inside, I know

Today's gonna be the day you notice
'Cause I'm tired of explainin' what the joke is

This is what you asked for, heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise, ashes rainin' down
Try to hold it in, but it keeps 
bleedin' out
This is what you asked for, heavy is the
Heavy is the crown

Turn to run, now look what it's become
Outnumbered, ten to one
Back thеn should've bit your tongue
'Cause thеre's no turnin' back this path once it's begun
You're already on that list
Say you don't want what you can't resist
Wavin' that sword when the pen won't miss
Watch it all fallin' apart like this

This is what you asked for, heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise, ashes rainin' down
Try to hold it in, but 
it keeps bleedin' out

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening? 

In the lane, snow is glistening
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walking in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird 

He sings a love song as we go along
Walking in a winter wonderland

In the meadow, we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, ""Are you married?"" We'll say, ""No man""
But you can do the job when you're in town

Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid, the plans that we've made
Walking in a winter wonderland

Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask
, 
backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes
, 
lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup
 
I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock

I am your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick

and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced

Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open, I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

Ultima Noite,['Leo Foguete'],"

Cheiro de cigarro e de amor antigo
Amo fuder contigo, amor, fode comigo
Essa é a última breja, esquece o mundo e me beija
Vivo entre coxas, entre curvas
Entro em ti pra me proteger da chuva
Tipo Didico me dedico
Te dedilho como B.B. King dedilhava Lucille
Cê sempre molha meus dedos, eu preciso de luvas
Sexo e drogas, como naqueles filmes
Amores tropicais, trepo mais
Entre tópicos, nova Tropicália
Nós vivemos nus, baby, apaga a luz
Me veja, eu sou a noite
Na cidade acende a luz, pois tem medo de mim
Amor, não acenda a luz, faça parte de mim
Faça parte de mim
Faça parte de mim
Faça parte de mim

E cê falando sobre a última noite
Vamo transar como se fosse a última noite
Me ame como se fosse a última noite
Me chupe como se fosse a última noite
Cê falando sobre a última noite
Vamo transar como se fosse
Me ame como se fosse
Me chupe como se fosse

Everything she never had, she's showin' off

She's headin' for somethin' that she won't forget
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants

 
We're only gettin' older, baby
 
And I've been thinkin' about it lately
 
Does it ever drive you crazy
 
Just how fast the night changes?
 
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
 
Disappearin' when you wake up
 
But there's nothin' to be afraid of
 
Even when the night changes
 
It will never change me and you

Chasin' her tonight, doubts are runnin' round her head
He's waitin', hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beatin' loud and she doesn't want it to stop
Movin' too fast, moon is lightin' up her skin
She's fallin', 
doesn't even know it yet
Havin' no regrets is all that she really wants

Take Me To Church,['Hozier'],"
My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick, you heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, ""Worship in the bedroom""
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

A, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea, get somethin' shiny
Somethin' meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithful
That looks tasty, that looks plenty
This is hungry work

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human, only then, I am clean

Oh, oh, amen
Amen, amen

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death

Said, ""No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars
Yeah, we'll be countin' stars""

I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

I feel something so right doin' the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong doin' the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said, ""No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars""
Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said, ""No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' stars"", yeah

I feel your love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told

I feel something so wrong doin' the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said, ""No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars""
Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said, ""No more countin' dollars, we'll be, we'll be countin' stars""

Oh, take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned

Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard
Said, ""No more countin' dollars, we'll be countin' stars""
Lately, I've been, I've been losin' sleep
Dreamin' about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been prayin' hard

Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned
Take that money, watch it burn
Sink in the river, the lessons I've learned"

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out 
But you never go away 
So I guess I gotta stay now

Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home

Walking out of time
Looking for a better place 
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space

But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear

Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin 
to
 bone
Hello, welcome home

Woah, yeah
Yeah, ah
Woah, woah
Hello, welcome home"
Like That,"['Future, Metro Boomin', 'Kendrick Lamar']","
Gotta fire my joint up on this bitch
Young Metro, young Metro, young Metro, three times
Yeah

Stickin' to the code, all these hoes for the streets
I put it in her nose, it's gon' make her pussy leak
Pussy niggas told, ain't gon' wake up out they sleep
You can't hear that switch, but you can hear them niggas scream
All my hoes do shrooms, nigga, all my hoes do coke
Twenty-carat ring, I put my fingers down her throat 
If I lose a carat, she might choke 
I know she gon' swallow, she a G.O.A.T. 
Freeband nigga, bring the racks in
Got the shooters in the corner like the pack in
She think 'cause she exotic bitch, she attractive
That's that shit'll get you put up out the section, brrt
And the motto still the same
Ball like I won a championship game
You know these hoes hungry, they gon' fuck for a name
I put her on the gang, she get fucked for a chain
Got your girl in this bitch, she twirlin' on the dick
I got syrup in this bitch, turn up in this bitch
And we brought the 'Ercs in this bitch, get murked in this bitch
All these pointers on me, baby, you know it's game time
Bring a friend, bitch, we fucked 'em at the same time
I'm a different nigga, no, we not the same kind
You can have that lil'— if she ain't mine 

Young dope dealer, sellin' dope, is you like that? 
Kickin' doors, kickin' in doors, is you like that? 
Young throwed nigga, sellin' loads, is you like that? 
All '24, you on go, is you like that? 
Niggas from the bottom really like that 
Steppin' in Balencis if you like that 
Pop another bottle if you like that 

He was once a thug from around the way

These niggas talkin' out of they necks
Don't pull no coffin out of your mouth,
 I'm way too paranoid for a threat
Ayy-ayy, let's get it, bro
D-O-T, the money, power, respect
The last one is better
Say, it's a lot of goofies with a check
I mean, ah, I hope them sentiments symbolic
Ah, my temperament bipolar, I choose violence
Okay, let's get it up, it's time for him to prove that he's a problem
Niggas clickin' up, but cannot be legit, no 40 Water, tell 'em
Ah, yeah, huh, yeah, get up with me
Fuck sneak dissin', first-person shooter, I hope they came with three switches
I crash out like, ""Fuck rap,"" diss Melle Mel if I had to
Got 2TEEZ with me, I'm snatchin' chains and burnin' tattoos, it's up
Lost too many soldiers not to play it safe
If he walk around with that stick, it ain't André 3K
Think I won't drop the location? I still got PTSD
Motherfuck the big three, nigga, it's just big me
Nigga, bum
What? I'm really like that
And your best work is a light pack
Nigga, Prince outlived Mike Jack'
Nigga, bum
'Fore all your dogs gettin' buried
That's a K with all these nines, he gon' see Pet Sematary 
Nigga, bum

He was once a thug, he was, he

Came in banging dope, niggas was young, slangin' powder
Walk in the strip club, make it rain for three hours
Locked in and now I got my Phantom and my driver
Perc'd out, took chances in my hood like Nevada
Surfed out outside, white interior, lasagna
Hundred thousands, I just cashed out on designer
Gotta devour, nigga, I learned that in the jungle
Once I sell this load, that's a million in a week"
